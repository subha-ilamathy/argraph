Creating specialized models and\ntools for these domains is crucial towards gaining the benefits of\nLLMs in areas such as HPC. While previous work has explored\nHPC-specific models, LLMs still struggle to generate parallel\ncode and it is not at all clear what hurdles are still holding back\nthese LLMs and what must be done to overcome them. In this\nwork, we conduct an in-depth study along the many axes of fine-\ntuning a specialized HPC LLM in order to better understand\nthe challenges. Based on our findings we fine-tune and evaluate\na specialized HPC LLM that is shown to be the best performing\nopen-source code LLM for parallel code generation to date.\nIndex Terms —Large Language Models, Code Generation, HPC\nI. I NTRODUCTION\nLarge language models (LLMs) have been a transforma-\ntional technology in aiding software development. Their ability\nto automate coding tasks and connect natural language de-\nscriptions to code has improved developer productivity and\nenabled developers to more rapidly move from concept to\nimplementation. As of 2023 over 92% of surveyed developers\nuse AI in some form to aid their development process [1].\nBeyond general development assistance these tools have the\npotential to enhance developer capabilities on more complex\nprogramming tasks such as writing parallel code. Writing\ncorrect, parallel code is an important problem facing modern\ndevelopers and is already difficult for humans. Using LLMs to\nimprove the quality and quantity of parallel code is an impor-\ntant step in improving the performance of modern software.\nWhile code LLMs have shown promise in their code gen-\neration capabilities, they still struggle with more complex\nprogramming tasks such as parallel code. Previous work [2]\nhas extensively studied LLMs across various parallel execution\nmodels and algorithms and found that LLMs are significantly\nworse at generating parallel code compared to sequential code.\nTwo main reasons are identified for this discrepancy: the lack\nof parallel code data in the pre-training data of modern LLMs\nand the intrinsic difficulty of parallel code generation. Solving\nthe latter issue is a long-term effort that will require the\ndevelopment of more sophisticated AI models that can plan\nand reason through complex problems. However, the former\n∗These authors contributed equally to this work.issue of obtaining high-quality parallel code data at scale and\neffectively learning from that data is a much more tractable\nproblem to tackle with current language modeling capabilities.\nCreating HPC and parallel capable LLMs offers a great\nnumber of benefits to the HPC community. They will dras-\ntically improve the productivity of scientific developers and,\nin turn, the speed at which scientific discoveries are made.\nThe process of designing these HPC capable LLMs will\ninvolve the creation of large HPC datasets and studies into\nmodeling that data. Building out a large corpus of HPC data\nand understanding how to best learn from and model that data\nwill be critical to developing future HPC AI developer tools.\nFurthermore, as the field of AI and code LLMs continues to\nprogress it is important that the HPC community understands\nand addresses the unique challenges associated with HPC code\ngeneration.\nGathering parallel code data at scale and effectively learning\nfrom it is difficult. The data samples are already underrepre-\nsented in large code datasets and simply collecting more is\noften not enough; high-quality parallel code data is needed\nto train models effectively. This is evinced by the results\nof the StarCoder2 project which trained code LLMs on The\nStack v2 dataset that contains nearly all permissively licensed\ncode and code related data online [3]. Despite the impressive\ndata collection efforts, the StarCoder2 models perform similar\nor worse than comparable models trained on less data. This\nsuggests that we cannot keep improving model performance\nby collecting more data, but rather we need to collect better\ndata. Furthermore, it is not well understood what makes data\n“better” for training code LLMs.\nIn this paper we address the lack of high-quality parallel\ncode data by creating a large synthetic code dataset, HPC-\nINSTRUCT , using our proposed methodology to map existing\nparallel code samples to high-quality instruct-answer pairs. We\nthen fine-tune code LLMs on this dataset and evaluate them\nagainst other code LLMs on ParEval [2], a state-of-the-art\nparallel code generation benchmark. We find that our fine-\ntuned model, HPC-Coder-V2, is the best performing open-\nsource code LLM for parallel code generation and performs\nnear GPT-4 level. We conduct an in-depth study to better\nunderstand how data representation and training parameters\nimpact the models ability to learn how to model parallel code.\nThese insights will be critical for future efforts developing the\nnext generation of HPC AI developer tools.arXiv:2412.15178v1  [cs.DC]  19 Dec 2024\nIn this paper we make the following important contributions.\n•We collect a large synthetic dataset of high quality\nparallel code instruction data, HPC-I NSTRUCT .\n•We fine-tune a code LLM, HPC-Coder-V2, that is most\ncapable open-source code LLM for parallel code gener-\nation.\n•We conduct an in-depth study along the data and fine-\ntuning parameters to understand how to best fine-tune\ncode LLMs for parallel code generation.\nFurthermore, we answer the following research questions:\nRQ1 How does the choice of fine-tuning base model and the\nuse of instruction masking impact the performance of a\ncode LLM on parallel code generation?\nRQ2 How does the amount of fine-tuning data for a particular\nparallel execution model affect the performance of a code\nLLM on that model?\nRQ3 How does the quality of parallel code fine-tuning data\nimpact the performance of a code LLM on parallel code\ngeneration?\nRQ4 How does model size impact the ability of a code LLM\nto learn from distilled synthetic data?\nII. B ACKGROUND\nIn this section we provide background on the use of LLMs\nfor code, LLM distillation, and fine-tuning instruction LLMs.\nA. LLMs for Code\nLLMs, based on the Transformer architecture [4], have\nproven to be capable of modeling text data, such as natural lan-\nguage and code. Most often used for generative tasks, they can\nbe employed in a variety of software development tasks, such\nas code completion, summarization, and translation. Building\noff of their success in these tasks, they are continually being\nintegrated into software development tools and workflows.\nCode LLMs are very similar to natural language LLMs,\nbut are generally pre-trained, fine-tuned, and/or prompted with\ndistinct code-specific data. For example, popular open-source\nmodels like StarCoder2 [3] is pre-trained on The Stack v2\ndataset [3], which is a large dataset of mostly code text.\nOther popular models like CodeLlama [5] use existing LLMs\nthat are pre-trained on natural language data and then fine-\ntuned on code-specific data. Popular code tools like GitHub\nCopilot simply call existing frontier LLMs like GPT-4o [6]\nwith heavily engineered prompts to generate code.\nB. LLM Knowledge Distillation\nLarge frontier LLMs, like GPT-4o [6], generally give the\nbest responses across a large variety of tasks, however, they\nare computationally and financially expensive to run. For this\nreason, the practice of knowledge distillation [7], where a\nsmaller model is trained to be as good as a larger model\nfor a particular sub-task, is becoming increasingly popular.\nKnowledge distillation techniques generally either employ a\nteacher-student model, where the teacher is the larger model\nand the student is the smaller model, or a model compression\ntechnique, where the larger model is compressed into a smallermodel. This work focuses on a simple form of teacher-student\nknowledge distillation, where the large model is used to\ngenerate lots of high quality synthetic data samples that are\nthen used to train a smaller model.\nC. Fine-tuning Instruction LLMs\nInstruction LLMs are a specialized form of LLMs that are\nfine-tuned to receive a natural language instruction from the\nuser and generate a response. They behave like a chatbot, but\ndo not necessarily handle multi-turn dialog. These are usually\ncreated by first selecting a general LLM that was pre-trained\non a corpus of general text data and then fine-tuning on a\ncorpus of dialog data. This is accomplished by showing the\nmodel samples in the format “Instruct: {instruction }Response:\n{response }” and then training the model to generate the\nresponse. This is generally very effective at getting LLMs to\nfollow user prompts and most models available today have an\ninstruction variant available.\nGenerally, instruction LLMs are fine-tuned using\ninstruction-masking . When fine-tuning with instruction\nmasking, the gradient values corresponding to the instruction\ntokens are masked to zero to prevent the model from learning\nto generate the instruction tokens. Instead, weights are only\nupdated based on its ability to predict missing tokens in\nthe response. Conceptually, this is done since there may be\nbad text in the instruction that we do not want the model to\nlearn to generate. For example, the user instructs the model\nto fix their buggy code. In this case the instruction will\ncontain bad code, which we do not want the model to learn\nto generate. Instead, we want the model to learn to generate\nthe fixed code in the response. While instruction-masking\nis common practice and conceptually clear, there is little\nliterature arguing quantitatively for its effectiveness.\nIII. O URAPPROACH TO IMPROVING CODE LLM S FOR\nPARALLEL LANGUAGES\nOur approach to improving Code LLMs for parallel lan-\nguages involves creating a large synthetic code dataset, HPC-\nINSTRUCT , and then fine-tuning existing pre-trained Code\nLLMs on this dataset. We first present an overview of our\nproposed approach (Figure 1) and then present details of the\nvarious components.\nWe begin by generating a large scale synthetic dataset of\ncode samples using open-source parallel code snippets and\nstate-of-the-art LLMs. This dataset is comprised of roughly\n120k parallel code instruction-response pairs where the in-\nstruction is a natural language problem description and the re-\nsponse is the code that solves the problem. The construction of\nthis dataset is inspired by previous work [8] that demonstrated\nthe success of fine-tuning smaller code LLMs on synthetic data\ngenerated from larger foundation models.\nUsing the HPC instruction dataset, we then conduct an in-\ndepth study along the axes of code model fine-tuning to better\nunderstand how data representation and quality, model size,\nand prompt construction impact the ability of a code LLM to\nlearn how to generate parallel code. During these studies we\nFig. 1: Overview of the methodology proposed in this paper.\nFirst, we use open-source parallel code snippets to generate a\nlarge synthetic instruction dataset of parallel code samples. We\nthen conduct ablation studies to understand how data, model,\nand fine-tuning parameters impact the capability of a code\nLLM to write parallel code. Finally, we utilize the dataset and\ninsights from the ablation studies to fine-tune a code LLM\nfor parallel code generation and evaluate it against other code\nLLMs on the parallel code generation benchmark ParEval.\nevaluate each of the fine-tuned models against the ParEval [2]\nbenchmark to understand their performance on real parallel\ncode generation tasks. These studies yield critical insights into\nbest practices for fine-tuning HPC code LLMs.\nFinally, with the full HPC instruction dataset and insights\nfrom the ablation studies, we fine-tune three state-of-the-art\nHPC capable code LLMs. These are evaluated against the\nParEval benchmark and compared to other state-of-the-art\nLLMs for their ability to generate parallel code.\nA. Ameliorating the Data Problem with Synthetic Data\nBefore we can fine-tune HPC LLMs, we need to collect a\nlarge dataset of HPC relevant code and dialog. While large\ndatasets of open-source code exist [3], previous work has\nshown that generating structured synthetic data with state-of-\nthe-art LLMs can yield data much more effective for fine-\ntuning specialized code LLMs [8]. This section details our\napproach to collecting large-scale synthetic data for HPC\nbased on this insight.\nWhile state-of-the-art commercial LLMs like GPT-4o can\ngenerate high-quality instruction samples, they tend to gen-\nerate very repetitive samples. To address this, we adapt the\nuse of seed code snippets from [8] to get diverse outputs\nfrom the LLM. We gather a diverse set of seed snippets from\nopen-source codebases in The Stack V2 [3], focusing on code\nin HPC languages (C, Fortran, etc.) and using HPC libraries\n(MPI, OpenMP, etc.). In total we collect 125k seed snippets\nincluding 25,000 samples in Python, C, FORTRAN, and C++,\n15,000 samples in CUDA, and 5,000 samples in Chapel and\nOpenCL. When asked to generate a data sample, the LLM is\nasked to be inspired by the seed snippet, yielding more diverse\nand creative outputs. We obtain further variety in the generated\ndata by generating multiple sample types: programming, trans-\nlation, optimization and parallelization problems. This process\nis visualized in Figure 2. An example programming template\nresponse can be seen in Figure 3, illustrating the workflow\nfrom seed snippet selection to the final dataset sample.Programming Prompts: In this template, the LLM is tasked\nwith generating a parallel programming problem and a corre-\nsponding solution.\nTranslation Prompts: The translation templates directs the\nLLM to create a problem focused on converting code from\none parallel programming language to another. For example,\nthe model might be prompted to translate a CUDA-based\nimplementation into OpenMP or OpenMP to MPI.\nOptimization Prompts: For these prompts, we ask the LLM\nto generate an optimization problem and a corresponding\nsolution.\nParallelization Prompts: The parallelization template asks the\nLLM to parallelize a given code snippet, transforming it from\na sequential implementation to an efficient parallel version.\nUsing the 125k formatted prompts we generate syn-\nthetic data samples with four state-of-the-art LLMs: Gemini-\nPro, DBRX, Llama-3-70B, and Mixtral-8x7B. The resulting\ndataset, named HPC-I NSTRUCT , comprises over 122k syn-\nthetic data samples (some outputs were not parsable and dis-\ncarded). We use several LLMs to gather a variety of samples,\nfurther ensuring data diversity. It also enables us to study the\nimpact of data quality along the axis of source generation\nmodel. An example data sample from HPC-I NSTRUCT is\nshown in Listing 1.\nB. Selecting a Pre-trained Model\nBefore fine-tuning, we need to first select a pre-trained\nmodel to fine-tune. When fine-tuning smaller open-source\nmodels, choosing a model already trained for code tasks tends\nto yield better results [9]. Based on this and the successful\nresults of previous code LLM fine-tuning studies [8] we select\nthe DeepSeek-Coder [10], [11] family of models for fine-\ntuning. In particular, we fine-tuned the 1.3b, 6.7b [10], and\n16b [11] parameter models. These models are state-of-the-\nart in code modeling and outperform other LLMs on many\ncoding benchmarks [9]–[11]. They are trained on a dataset\nof 87% code and 13% natural language with a 16k context\nwindow. The 1.3b and 6.7b are based on the llama [12] model\narchitecture, while the 16b is a custom mixture-of-experts\n(MOE) [13] architecture. The MOE architecture enables the\n16b model to scale to larger sizes while maintaining runtime\nperformance.\nC. Fine-Tuning on Synthetic HPC Code Data\nWe fine-tune each of the models on the HPC-I NSTRUCT ,\nMagicoder-OSS-Instruct-75K [8], and Evol-Instruct-Code-\n80k-v1 [14] datasets. The latter two datasets are state-of-the-\nart synthetic and semi-synthetic code instruction datasets. We\ninclude these since, although they are not HPC specific, they\ncan still improve the model’s generalization capabilities. In\ntotal the fine-tuning dataset has 277k samples.\nWe use the AxoNN [15] framework to fine-tune the models.\nThis is a parallel deep learning framework wrapped around\nPyTorch [16]. It handles automatically parallelizing the model\nacross GPUs and allows us to fine-tune the models that do not\nfit in memory on a single node. The 6.7b and 16b models are\nSampling Seed\nSnippetsCreating Prompts\nProgramming\nproblem\nCode\noptimization\nproblemCode\ntranslation\nproblem\nCode\nparallelization\nproblem    Data\nProblem\nStatement\nSolutionOpen Source\nCodebaseGenerating Code\nusing LLMsFig. 2: Synthetic data generation process. We collect seed snippets from open source codebases and combine them with multiple\nprompt templates to create data generation prompts for an LLM.

The\ntotal fine-tuning times range between 3 and 20 hours.\nWe fine-tune the 1.3b and 6.7b models in bfloat16 precision\nwith a batch size of 128 and a sequence length of 8192\nfor two epochs. The 16b model is fine-tuned with a batch\nsize of 1024 for one epoch. Furthermore, we employ the\nAdamW optimizer [17] to update the model weights based on\nthe fine-tuning loss. This training setup and hyperparameters\nare selected based on those used in related literature to fine-\ntune code LLMs. Cursory experiments showed that these\nhyperparameters work well for our fine-tuning task, however, it\nis possible that an exhaustive search could yield better results.Performance hyperparameters, like batch size, are selected\nbased on the model size, available GPU memory, and desired\nperformance. The context window length is lowered from 16k\nto 8k from the base models, since none of the data samples\nin the dataset exceed 8k tokens and this saves memory and\nperformance during fine-tuning.\nIV. S TUDIES EXPLORING THE CREATION OF IMPROVED\nHPC C ODE LLM S\nWe now have a large dataset of synthetic instruction HPC\ndata, HPC-I NSTRUCT , and the setup to fine-tune code LLMs\non it. However, there are many unknowns regarding how to\nbest fine-tune these models such as how to format prompts,\nhow much and what quality of data to use, what size of model\nto use, etc. In this section, we present a series of ablation\nstudies along different axes of model fine-tuning to better\nunderstand how each contributes to the ability of a fine-tuned\ncode LLM to generate parallel code.\nA. Choice of Base Model and Instruction Masking\nIn this experiment, we fine-tune the Deepseek-Coder 1.3B\nand 6.7B base and instruct models with and without instruction\nmasking on the HPC-I NSTRUCT , Magicoder-OSS-Instruct-\n75K, and Evol-Instruct-Code-80k-v1 datasets. In total there\nare eight models fine-tuned: {1.3B, 6.7B } × { base, instruct }\n× {masked, unmasked }. We omit the 16B model from this\nexperiment due to its high computational cost for fine-tuning.\nThe goal of this experiment is to better understand the impact\nof the choice of base model and instruction masking. We\nchoose to study the impact of base versus instruct models as\nit is unclear from related literature which model type is better\nfor fine-tuning on specific tasks. Generally, most users interact\nwith instruct models as they are able to follow instructions\nand better engage in dialog-like interactions. For this reason,\nmost open-source models have instruct models available that\nhave been fine-tuned from a base model. When fine-tuning a\nnew instruct model, on one hand, it may be better to reap the\nbenefits of the existing fine-tuned model and start from there.\nOn the other hand, it may be better to start from scratch with\na base model, since they will be more general and easier to\nfine-tune.\nWe also study the impact of instruction masking (see Sec-\ntion II-C). Instruction masking is usually employed to prevent\nthe model from learning bad patterns that may be present in\nthe user instruction. We only want to learn from the responses.\nWhile intuitive, we are actually learning from less information\nwhen we mask the instruction and it is unclear if this trade-off\nbetween learning from less information and learning from less\nnoise is worth it.\nB. Studying the Impact of the Amount and Quality of Parallel\nCode Data\nEven with an ideal base model and prompting strategy it\nis still difficult to fine-tune a good model without the right\namount and quality of data. To further explore this, we conduct\ntwo experiments: one to study the impact of the amount of\ndata from individual parallel models and another to study the\nimpact of the quality of data.\nFor the first experiment, we create several versions of the\nHPC-I NSTRUCT each with varying amounts of MPI code\nsamples: 0k, 2k, 4k, 6k, 8k, 10k, and 12k. We leave the\nother data in the dataset unchanged and just vary the amount\nof MPI data. MPI samples are identified by the presence of\ncertain substrings like “mpi.h” or “MPI Init” in the code.\nThese datasets are used to fine-tune the 1.3B and 6.7B models\nresulting in 14 total models. The purpose of this study is to\nshed light on how the amount of data from a specific parallel\nmodel affects the final performance of the LLM on that parallel\nmodel. Does performance keep increasing with more data or\ndoes it plateau at some point? This is important as it informs\nhow we collect future data for fine-tuning. We select MPI for\nthis study as LLMs consistently perform worse at generating\nMPI code than any other parallel programming model [2] and,\ntherefore, it is desirable to improve their ability to generate\nMPI code.\nTangetially, we also study the impact of the quality of data\non the fine-tuned models. As LLMs are increasingly getting\nmore dependent on synthetic data for training, it is also getting\nextremely important to validate the quality of the synthetic\ndata being produced to see its effect on model performance.\nWe hypothesize that there is a trade-off between the amount of\ndata and the quality of data, where eventually more data stops\nimproving performance and quality becomes more important.\nUnderstanding this trade-off is particularly vital for synthetic\ndata where we are expending compute to create the data; we\nneed to know whether compute time is better spent on more\ndata or better data.\nDirectly studying data quality is difficult as it is hard to\nquantify and the scale of data is too large for qualitative\nanalysis. In order to overcome this we instead use the base\nmodel used for generating the synthetic data as a proxy for\ndifferences in data quality. We presume that the diffent models\ngenerate data of different quality. This will not allow us to\ninfer what makes the data better or worse, but it will allow us\nto see if quality impacts the ability of the fine-tuned model\nto generate parallel code. To conduct this experiment we\nfine-tune the 1.3B and 6.7B models on the HPC-I NSTRUCTdataset generated from four different LLMs: Gemini-Pro,\nDBRX, Llama-3-70B, and Mixtral-8x7B. We also fine-tune\nboth models on all of the data together. This results in ten\ntotal models that we can compare to see if the quality of the\ndata impacts the final performance of the fine-tuned model.\nC. Studying the Impact of Model Size\nFinally, we aim to study how model size impacts the final\nperformance of a fine-tuned model. While larger models tend\nto be better at most tasks, there is a trade-off where the time\nand resources necessary to run a larger model may not be\nworth the marginal increase in performance. For example, if a\n7B parameter model is able to generate code for a particular\nniche task nearly as well as a 70B parameter model, then it\nis likely much more practical for a user to simply use the 7B\nmodel. It will run quickly on a consumer laptop whereas the\n70B model will require specialized hosting or multiple GPUs.\nTo study the impact of model size, we fine-tune the 1.3B,\n6.7B, and 16B models on the HPC-I NSTRUCT dataset. This\nwill allow us to compare the performance of the models across\ndifferent sizes and see if the larger models are worth the extra\nresources.\nV. E VALUATION OF CODE LLM S FOR PARALLEL CODE\nGENERATION\nWith many different versions of the models fine-tuned,\nwe now need a way to evaluate their efficacy for parallel\ncode generation and compare them. This will allow us to\nunderstand the impact of different fine-tuning and data setups\non the final model performance. In this section we detail the\nbenchmarks and metrics used to compare models for parallel\ncode generation.\nA. Benchmark Used\nWhen evaluating LLMs for code generation it is imperative\nto evaluate them on code correctness. To do this for par-\nallel code generation we use the state-of-the-art benchmark\nParEval [2]. ParEval has 420 coding problems that it uses\nto test an LLM’s parallel code generation capabilities. These\nproblems range across 12 different problem types: sort, scan,\ndense linear algebra, sparse linear algebra, search, reduce,\nhistogram, stencil, graph, geometry, fourier transform and\ntransform help us show the diversity on which the model\nhas been tested on. For each of the problem types there\nare problems across seven different execution models: mpi,\nmpi+omp, cuda, kokkos, serial, hip, omp. ParEval provides\ndrivers to run and unit test the generated code for correctness.\nFurthermore, the results can be analyzed along the many\ndifferent axes of the problem types and execution models.\nWe also compared our model’s memory requirements and\nthroughput with other models to better understand the trade-\noffs between model size, performance and accuracy. These\nnumbers are recorded on the ParEval benchmark when gener-\nating outputs using an H100 and a batch size of one. These\nresults are important to users who may be constrained by\nhardware with limited memory or speed.\nB. Metrics for Comparison\nSince LLMs are probabilistic and may output different\nresults for the same problem it is generally best to evaluate\nthem in a probabilistic manner. For code LLMs most papers\nhave adopted the pass@ kmetric to do this [18]. This metric\nquantifies the probability that an LLM can generate at least one\ncorrect solution within kattempts. Since we cannot calculate\nthis probability directly we need to estimate it. To do this for\none prompt, N samples are generated where N is much greater\nthan k, which are then evaluated on code correctness and used\nto estimate pass@k. Choosing N to be much greater than k\nensures that we can compute a statistically significant estimate\nof pass@k. The pass@ kcompute is shown in Equation (1).\npass@ k=1\n|P|X\np∈P\"\n1−\u0012N−cp\nk\u0013\n/\u0012N\nk\u0013#\n(1)Number of samples generated per prompt\nSet of promptsNumber of correct\nsamples for prompt p\nTo further demonstrate pass@ k, say we want to generate a\npass@1 score for a model, it will generate N= 10 samples\nfor a given prompt and out of these cp= 3samples are correct.\nUsing the formula, we will get a score of 0.3 so the model has\na 30 percent chance of generating the correct solution in it’s\nfirst attempt. The pass@1 metric is an important benchmark\nthat is used to evaluate models’ usability which is why we\nuse it to compare our model with other models to see where it\nstands. In recent years, papers have resorted to just reporting\npass@ kfork= 1 as LLMs have become more powerful\nand can generate correct code more often. It is also a more\ndesirable metric for the user who wants code to be generated\ncorrectly the first time.\nC. Other Models Used for Evaluation\nWe compare our final models with several other state-of-\nthe-art code LLMs to better understand their performance and\nour study’s insights can lead to improvements in the field. We\ncompare our models with the following models:\n•StarCoder2 (1.3B, 7B, 15B) : LLMs pre-trained on a\nlarge corpus of mostly code data from The Stack V2 [3].\n•Magicoder (6.7B) : A fine-tuning of the DeepseekCoder-\n6.7B model fine-tuned on synthetic data generated based\non open-source code [8].\n•Phind-V2 (34B) : A fine-tuning of the CodeLlama-\n34B [5] model on a proprietary dataset [19]. At the time\nof its release it was the best model on the BigCode\nleaderboard [9].\n•Gemini-1.5-flash : A commercial model avaiable via API\nfrom Google [20].\n•GPT-3.5, GPT-4 : State-of-the-art commercial LLMs\nfrom OpenAI only accessible via API [21], [22].\nVI. R ESULTS OF ABLATION STUDIES\nWith the different models trained across the various config-\nurations and data partitions, we can now analyze each model’sparallel code generation performance to better understand the\nimpact of different training configurations. In this section we\ndetail the results from each of these ablation studies and\nprovide insights into how to best train an HPC specialized\ncode LLM.\nA. Choice of Base Model and Instruction Masking\nRQ1 How does the choice of fine-tuning base model\nand the use of instruction masking impact the perfor-\nmance of a code LLM on parallel code generation?\nFigure 4 details the parallel code generation results on\nParEval for the masked/unmasked and instruct/non-instruct\nprompt formats. There are eight models shown in the figure;\nthey were fine-tuned on the Deepseek-Coder base models and\nthe Deepseek-Coder instruct models using either masked or\nunmasked gradients. We observe little correlation between\nusing masked and unmasked gradients on the instruction\nprompts . Using masked gradients instead of unmasked pro-\nvides a slight less than one percentage point improvement\nfor the 1.3B models. However, using masked gradients hurt\nperformance when fine-tuning the 6.7B model. This goes\nagainst traditional wisdom that using masked gradients is\nbetter for fine-tuning instruction models.\nunmasked masked020406080100Pass@1\n20.2 20.831.8 31.1Base Model\n1.3B\n6.7B\nunmasked masked020406080100\n15.8 16.529.9 30.3Instruct Model\n1.3B\n6.7BComparison of Parallel Code Generation Pass@1\nfor Fine-T uning Prompt Strategies\nFig. 4: ParEval parallel code generation scores for various\nprompt formats.

There is no\ncorrelation in parallel code generation performance between\nmasked and unmasked gradients, however, fine-tuning the base\nmodel rather than the instruct gives much better results for\nboth 1.3B and 6.7B models.\nUnlike for masking, there is a notable difference between\nfine-tuning the base version of a model and an existing instruct\nvariant. We observe that fine-tuning base models, rather\nthan instruct variants, leads to better performance at par-\nallel code generation. This is true across all configurations:\n1.3B and 6.7B models, masked and unmasked gradients. The\ndifference is most pronounced for the 1.3B models, where fine-\ntuning the base models gives a roughly 4 percentage point\nadvantage over fine-tuning the instruct models. While it is\ndifficult to pinpoint the exact cause of this difference, it is\nlikely that the instruct models were fine-tuned to model a\nless general distribution when they were first fine-tuned from\nthe base model. In other words, it is better to fine-tune base\nmodels and not fine-tunings of them, since the base models\nare more general and can be fine-tuned to a specific task more\neffectively.\nB. Studying the Impact of the Amount and Quality of Parallel\nCode Data\nRQ2 How does the amount of fine-tuning data for a\nparticular parallel execution model affect the perfor-\nmance of a code LLM on that model?\nFigure 5 presents the MPI code generation performance for\nvarious amounts of MPI fine-tuning data. MPI is selected for\nthis study since LLMs consistently perform worse at generat-\ning MPI code than any other parallel execution model [2] and,\ntherefore, it is desirable to improve their ability to generate\nMPI code. In total there are 14 models shown in the figure:\nthe 1.3B and 6.7B Deepseek-Coder models each fine-tuned on\ndatasets with 0k, 2k, 4k, 6k, 8k, 10k, and 12k MPI samples.\nAfter running ParEval’s MPI benchmarks on these models,\nwe observe that increasing the amount of training data\nfor a particular parallel execution model can improve the\nperformance of smaller code LLMs on that model with\ndiminishing returns, but has little to no effect on larger\nmodels.\n0k 2k 4k 6k 8k 10k 12k\nNumber of MPI Training Samples0510152025Pass@1\nPass@1 for ParEval MPI Problems\n1.3B\n6.7B\nFig. 5: ParEval MPI code generation performance for increas-\ning amounts of MPI fine-tuning date. As the amount of MPI\nfine-tuning date increases the smaller 1.3B model sees an in-\ncrease in ability to generate MPI code with diminishing returns\nafter 6k samples. The larger 6.7B model sees no improvement\nin MPI code generation performance with additional data.\nThe 1.3B models see a gradual increase in MPI code\ngeneration performance until 6k MPI samples, after which the\nperformance plateaus and eventually decreases at 12k MPI\nsamples. The plateau can be explained by smaller models\nbeing more susceptible to overfitting. The 6.7B models, onthe other hand, have fairly consistent MPI code generation\nperformance across all amounts of MPI fine-tuning data. The\nmodel has already learned all it can from the data and adding\nmore has no effect on performance.\nRQ3 How does the quality of parallel code fine-\ntuning data impact the performance of a code LLM\non parallel code generation?\nIn addition to the amount of data, the quality of the data\ncan also impact the ability of an LLM to learn from it. To\nstudy this, we examine the performance of the models when\nfine-tuned on HPC-I NSTRUCT synthetic data with different\nLLMs used to generate the data. Figure 6 shows the ParEval\nperformance of each of these models. We observe that the\nquality of the parallel code fine-tuning data can have a\nsignificant impact on the performance of a code LLM\non parallel code generation. Models trained on Llama3-70B\ngenerated data have up to six percentage points higher parallel\ncode generation performance than those trained on DBRX\ndata. While it is difficult quantify the quality of these data\nsamples, it is clear that the quality of the data does lead to\na measurable difference in generation quality. This motivates\nfurther investigation into what makes a training data sample\nhigh quality.\nDBRX Mixtral Gemini Llama All\nData Source020406080100Pass@1\n17.8920.12 20.4023.5020.1531.15 30.35 32.01 33.28 31.81Comparison of Parallel Code Generation Pass@1\nfor Different Fine-T uning Data Sources\n1.3B\n6.7B\nFig. 6: ParEval parallel code generation performance across\ndifferent synthetic data sources. There is a clear difference\nin performance across data sources with Llama generated\nsynthetic data leading to the best performing LLMs and DBRX\nleading to the worst.\nC. Studying the Impact of Model Size\nRQ4 How does model size impact the ability of a code\nLLM to learn from distilled synthetic data?\nFinally, we investigate the impact of base model size when\nfine-tuning a code LLM. This is a crucial question as larger\nmodels are considerably more expensive to fine-tune, store,\nand deploy for inference. Understanding the trade-offs be-\ntween size and generative capabilities is essential for designing\npractical code LLMs. Figure 7 shows the ParEval performance\nof the 1.3B, 6.7B, and 16B models fine-tuned on the same\nHPC-I NSTRUCT data. We observe a significant increase\nin performance from 1.3B to 6.7B, but a much smaller\nincrease from 6.7B to 16B.\n1.3B 6.7B 16B020406080100Pass@1\n23.533.3 34.1Parallel Pass@1 Across Model Sizes\nFig. 7: ParEval serial and parallel code generation performance\nalong various base model sizes. There is a significant increase\nin performance from 1.3B to 6.7B, but a much smaller increase\nfrom 6.7B to 16B.\nThe diminishing return as model size increases is expected\nas we are using knowledge distillation to train the models;\nthe performance of the LLMs is unlikely to surpass the\nperformance of the teacher model. Based on the ParEval\nresults in [2], the 16B model is approaching the parallel code\ngeneration performance of foundation models like GPT-3.5\nand GPT-4.\nVII. HPC-C ODER -V2: A NIMPROVED CODE LLM FOR\nPARALLEL CODE GENERATION\nUsing the insights from the ablation studies we train a\nseries of models with the best configuration to create state-\nof-the-art parallel code generation LLMs. In this section we\nevaluate these models, HPC-Coder-V2-1.3B, HPC-Coder-V2-\n6.7B, and HPC-Coder-V2-16B, on the ParEval benchmark\nsuite and compare their performance with other state-of-the-\nart code LLMs. Appendix C has the full ParEval results for\nall models.\nA. HPC-Coder-V2 Across Problem Types and Execution Mod-\nels\nFigure 8 shows the code generation performance of HPC-\nCoder-V2 across the twelve problem types in the ParEval\nbenchmark suite. We observe similar trends to those shown\nin [2] except with higher performance across all problem types.\nThe LLMs tend to struggle with sparse unstructured problems,\nsuch as sparse linear algebra and geometric problems. The\nmodels perform much better on dense, structured problems\nsuch as dense linear algebra ,stencil , and simple data transfor-\nmation problems. With the exception of geometric problems,the models perform better as their size increases with the 16B\nmodel performing the best across all problem types. Interest-\ningly, the models perform worse on geometric problems as the\nmodel size increases.\nAnother axis of comparison besides problem type is the\nparallel execution model. Figure 9 shows the code generation\nperformance of the three LLMs across the seven execution\nmodels in ParEval. As with the problem types we see similar\ntrends as in [2]. The LLMs always perform best on serial\ncode followed by OpenMP . This is expected as OpenMP\ncode is most similar to its serial counterpart. The next best\nperforming execution models are the GPU models, CUDA and\nHIP. These are followed by Kokkos and the MPI models, MPI\nandMPI+OpenMP , reinforcing the trend that LLMs struggle\nwith MPI code generation.\nB. Comparison with Other Models\nFinally, we compare the performance of the HPC-Coder-\nV2 models with other state-of-the-art code LLMs. Figure 10\nshows ParEval parallel and serial code generation performance\nacross all models (an expanded list of models is shown in\nAppendix C). We see that, while the commercial models\nstill dominate, the HPC-Coder-V2 models are competitive.\nAt each relative model size class we see that the HPC-\nCoder-V2 models perform better than comparative models for\nparallel code generation. The HPC-Coder-V2-1.3B is signifi-\ncantly better than StarCoder2-3B despite being much smaller.\nFurthermore, the HPC-Coder-V2-6.7B model performs better\nthan the 34B Phind-V2 model. Despite their success at parallel\ncode generation, the HPC-Coder-V2 models are still beaten\nby Magicoder-6.7B for serial code. This highlights, however,\nthe success of our data and fine-tuning strategies at training\nmodels to generate parallel code.\nAlthough parallel code correctness is the most important\nmetric for an HPC code LLM, the system requirements of\nthe model and the speed at which it can generate code are\nalso very important to developers. A model that can generate\ncorrect code nearly as often as a larger model, but can run\nquickly on a consumer laptop, is arguably much more useful\nfor developers than the larger model. To study this trade-\noff in the HPC-Coder-V2 models, we present the throughput,\nrequired memory, and ParEval parallel pass@1 results for each\nmodel in Figure 11. The size of the dots are scaled based on the\nmemory requirement of the model with larger dots indicating\nlarger models. The ideal location for a model is the top right\nwhere the model generates correct code quickly.\nWe see that the HPC-Coder-V2 models generate parallel\ncode just as well or better than the other models while\nbeing faster and more memory efficient. HPC-Coder-V2-\n6.7B is significantly faster than Phind-V2-34B while requiring\nmuch less memory and having slightly better performance on\nParEval. Magicoder-6.7B has similar throughput and memory\nrequirements as HPC-Coder-V2-6.7B, but performs worse at\ngenerating parallel code. The HPC-Coder-V2-1.3B model is\nthe fastest and requires the least amount of memory, yet it\noutperforms other models in its size class (StarCoder2-3B).\nHPC-Coder-V2-1.3B HPC-Coder-V2-6.7B HPC-Coder-V2-16B020406080100Pass@1Pass@1 by Problem Type\nsparse_la\nfftgeometry\nscansort\nhistogramgraph\nsearchreduce\nstencildense_la\ntransformFig. 8: ParEval code generation performance by problem type.

R ELATED WORK\nIn this section we highlight related literature on the use and\ndesign of code LLMs for HPC and parallel code. We further\ndiscuss works focused on fine-tuning specialized code LLMs.\nA. Code LLMs for HPC\nSince code LLMs became popular with OpenAI’s copi-\nlot [18] many works have focused on adapting these models for\nHPC and parallel code [2], [23]–[28]. These works generally\nfall into two categories: (1) creating improved LLMs that are\nbetter at HPC tasks and (2) engineering HPC agents and tools\nto leverage existing state-of-the-art LLMs for HPC tasks . Our\nwork falls into the first category, so we focus on literature\nin this area. However, we note that the models and insights\ncontributed in our work will be invaluable for studies in the\nsecond category [24], [29], [30].Several papers that focus on creating improved LLMs\nfor HPC tasks have focused on more narrow tasks within\nHPC code generation. Schneider et al. [23] introduce the\nMPIrigen model approach for generating MPI code. OMPGPT\nis introduced by Chen et al [31] for generating OpenMP\ncode. None of these works focus on creating general code\nLLMs that can handle a wide variety of HPC tasks. The\nmost similar to this work, Nichols et al. [27], fine-tuned\nthe HPC-Coder model using scraped HPC data from GitHub\nand the PolyCoder base model [32]. While this work fine-\ntuned a general HPC model, the base LLM used, PolyCoder,\nis significantly out-of-date compared to the state-of-the-art\nmodels used in this work. For reference, PolyCoder is based\non the GPT-2 architecture and achieves a pass@1 of 5.59%\non the HumanEval benchmark [18] whereas even the smallest\nmodel used in this work, Deepseek-Coder-1.3B [33], achieves\na pass@1 of 65.2% on the same benchmark.\nB. Fine-tuning Specialized Code LLMs\nBeyond HPC there are a great many of works that focus on\nfine-tuning code LLMs for specialized tasks or domains. Tang\net al [34] introduce BioCoder to address code generation tasks\nin the biological domain. Liu et al [35] introduce VerilogEval\nfor evaluating LLMs on Verilog code generation tasks. Other\nworks focus on more abstract issues that arise when creat-\ning specialized code LLMs. Cassano et al [36] introduce a\nmethodology for overcoming data limitations for low-resource\nlanguages. This is aimed to aid in cases where not enough data\nis available in a particular programming language to effectively\ntrain a model. While the semi-synthetic approach in the paper\nmay be useful for HPC data, we found in our results that data\namount was not the primary issue for HPC code LLMs, but\nrather data quality. Another paper exploring both data amount\nand quality by Wei et al [8] uses LLM generated synthetic\ndata to overcome data limitations. The data collection portion\nof our work is an extension of the ideas in this paper for HPC\ndata.\nHPC-Coder-V2\n1.3BStarCoder2\n3BMagicoder\n6.7BHPC-Coder-V2\n6.7BStarCoder2\n7BStarCoder2\n15BHPC-Coder-V2\n16BPhind-V2\n34BGemini-Pro GPT -3.5 GPT -4020406080100Pass@154.7\n42.773.6\n67.2\n59.461.672.8\n65.6\n59.376.0 76.1\n23.5\n9.630.433.3\n15.923.134.132.1\n25.139.6 37.8Code Generation Performance Comparison on ParEval\nserial\nparallelFig. 10: Comparison of ParEval parallel and serial code generation performance across all models.

We see that the 6.7B model gets similar perfor-\nmance to the much larger 34B model while generating tokens\nsignificantly faster.\nIX. C ONCLUSION\nIn this paper we introduced a new HPC instruction dataset,\nHPC-I NSTRUCT , using synthetic data generated from LLMs\nand open-source parallel code. Using this dataset we con-\nduct an in-depth study along the data, model, and prompt\nconfiguration axes of model fine-tuning to better understand\nhow individual choices impact the ability of a code LLM to\ngenerate parallel code. From this study we find the following\ninsights:\n•Instruction masking during fine-tuning has little to no\nimpact on the ability of a code LLM to generate parallel\ncode.\n•Fine-tuning base models, rather than their instruct vari-\nants, leads to better parallel code generation capabilities.•Increasing the amount of training data for a particular\nparallel execution model can improve the performance\nof smaller code LLMs on that model with diminishing\nreturns, but has little to no effect on larger models.\n•The quality of the parallel code fine-tuning data can have\na significant impact on the performance of a code LLM\non parallel code generation.\n•Moving from small to medium size HPC code LLMs can\nlead to significant improvements, while further increasing\nmodel size has diminishing returns.\nUsing these insights and the HPC-I NSTRUCT dataset we\nfine-tuned three state-of-the-art HPC code LLMs: HPC-Coder-\nV2-1.3B, HPC-Coder-V2-6.7B, and HPC-Coder-V2-16B. We\nevaluated these models on the ParEval benchmark and com-\npared them to other state-of-the-art code LLMs. We found\nthat our models are currently the best performing open-source\nmodels at generating parallel code. Furthermore, our models\nrun faster and use less memory than other models with similar\nor even less parallel code generation capabilities. The models\nand insights contributed in this work will be invaluable for\nboth HPC developers and future studies into code LLMs for\nHPC.\nREFERENCES\n[1] I.

The component, responsible for aggregating\nstatistical metrics, is currently sequential and\nbottlenecking the entire system. Your mission is to\nparallelize the aggregation process to significantly reduce\nthe processing time. The statistical metrics are stored in\na 2D array `data `of size `ROWS x COLS `, where each element\n`data[i][j] `represents a data point. The aggregation\nfunction, `compute_metric `, takes a single data point as\ninput and returns a metric value. The goal is to compute\nthe sum of metric values for all data points in the array.\nThe original sequential code is as follows:\n```c\nintcompute_metric( intdata_point) {\n// complex computation involving data_point\nreturnresult;\n}\nvoidaggregate_metrics( int**data, introws, intcols) {\nintsum = 0;\nfor(inti = 0; i < rows; i++) {\nfor(intj = 0; j < cols; j++) {\nsum += compute_metric(data[i][j]);\n}\n}\nprintf(\"Sum of metrics: %d \\n\", sum);\n}\n```\nYour task is to parallelize the `aggregate_metrics `\nfunction using OpenMP to take advantage of multiple CPU\ncores. The `compute_metric `function remains unchanged.\n**Solution **\nTo parallelize the `aggregate_metrics `function, we can use\nOpenMP's parallel for directive to distribute the\ncomputation across multiple threads. We'll also employ\nOpenMP's reduction clause to safely accumulate the partial\nsums computed by each thread. Here's the parallelized code:\n```c\n#include <omp.h>\nintcompute_metric( intdata_point) {\n// complex computation involving data_point\nreturnresult;\n}\nvoidaggregate_metrics( int**data, introws, intcols) {\nintsum = 0;\n#pragma omp parallel for reduction(+:sum)\nfor(inti = 0; i < rows; i++) {\nfor(intj = 0; j < cols; j++) {\nsum += compute_metric(data[i][j]);\n}\n}\nprintf(\"Sum of metrics: %d \\n\", sum);\n}\n```\nIn this solution:\n*We added the `#pragma omp parallel for `directive to\nparallelize the outer loop, which iterates over the rows\nof the 2D array.\n*We used the `reduction(+:sum) `clause to specify that\neach thread should maintain its own partial sum, which\nwill be combined using the `+`operator at the end of the\nparallel region. This ensures that the final sum is\ncorrectly computed.\n*The inner loop, which iterates over the columns, is\nexecuted sequentially within each thread, as it has no\ndependencies between iterations. By parallelizing the\n`aggregate_metrics `function, we can significantly reduce\nthe processing time for large datasets, taking advantage\nof the available CPU cores.\nListing 1: Example problem statement from the HPC-\nINSTRUCT dataset.

Un-\nfortunately, existing LM pipelines are typically implemented using hard-coded\n“prompt templates”, i.e. lengthy strings discovered via trial and error. Toward a\nmore systematic approach for developing and optimizing LM pipelines, we intro-\nduce DSPy, a programming model that abstracts LM pipelines as text transforma-\ntion graphs , i.e. imperative computation graphs where LMs are invoked through\ndeclarative modules. DSPy modules are parameterized , meaning they can learn\n(by creating and collecting demonstrations) how to apply compositions of prompt-\ning, finetuning, augmentation, and reasoning techniques. We design a compiler\nthat will optimize any DSPy pipeline to maximize a given metric. We conduct\ntwo case studies, showing that succinct DSPy programs can express and optimize\nsophisticated LM pipelines that reason about math word problems, tackle multi-\nhop retrieval, answer complex questions, and control agent loops. Within minutes\nof compiling, a few lines of DSPy allow GPT-3.5 andllama2-13b-chat to self-\nbootstrap pipelines that outperform standard few-shot prompting (generally by\nover 25% and 65%, respectively) and pipelines with expert-created demonstra-\ntions (by up to 5–46% and 16–40%, respectively). On top of that, DSPy pro-\ngrams compiled to open and relatively small LMs like 770M-parameter T5and\nllama2-13b-chat are competitive with approaches that rely on expert-written\nprompt chains for proprietary GPT-3.5 .\nDSPy is available at https://github.com/stanfordnlp/dspy .\n1 I NTRODUCTION\nLanguage models (LMs) are enabling researchers to build NLP systems at higher levels of abstrac-\ntion and with lower data requirements than ever before (Bommasani et al., 2021). This is fueling an\nexploding space of “prompting” techniques—and lightweight finetuning techniques—for adapting\nLMs to new tasks (Kojima et al., 2022), eliciting systematic reasoning from them (Wei et al., 2022;\nWang et al., 2022b), and augmenting them with retrieved sources (Guu et al., 2020; Lazaridou et al.,\n2022; Khattab et al., 2022) or with tools (Yao et al., 2022; Schick et al., 2023). Most of these tech-\nniques are explored in isolation, but interest has been growing in building multi-stage pipelines and\nagents that decompose complex tasks into more manageable calls to LMs in an effort to improve\nperformance (Qi et al., 2019; Khattab et al., 2021a; Karpas et al., 2022; Dohan et al., 2022; Khot\net al., 2022; Khattab et al., 2022; Chen et al., 2022; Pourreza & Rafiei, 2023; Shinn et al., 2023).\nUnfortunately, LMs are known to be sensitive to how they are prompted for each task, and this is\nexacerbated in pipelines where multiple LM calls have to interact effectively. As a result, the LM\n1arXiv:2310.03714v1  [cs.CL]  5 Oct 2023\nPreprint\ncalls in existing LM pipelines and in popular developer frameworks are generally implemented using\nhard-coded ‘prompt templates’, that is, long strings of instructions and demonstrations that are hand\ncrafted through manual trial and error. We argue that this approach, while pervasive, can be brittle\nand unscalable—conceptually akin to hand-tuning the weights for a classifier. A given string prompt\nmight not generalize to different pipelines or across different LMs, data domains, or even inputs.\nToward a more systematic approach to designing AI pipelines, we introduce the DSPy programming\nmodel.1DSPy pushes building new LM pipelines away from manipulating free-form strings and\ncloser to programming (composing modular operators to build text transformation graphs) where a\ncompiler automatically generates optimized LM invocation strategies and prompts from a program.\nWe draw inspiration from the consensus that emerged around neural network abstractions (Bergstra\net al., 2013), where (1) many general-purpose layers can be modularly composed in any complex\narchitecture and (2) the model weights can be trained using optimizers instead of being hand-tuned.\nTo this end, we propose the DSPy programming model (Sec 3). We first translate string-based\nprompting techniques, including complex and task-dependent ones like Chain of Thought (Wei et al.,\n2022) and ReAct (Yao et al., 2022), into declarative modules that carry natural-language typed sig-\nnatures . DSPy modules are task-adaptive components—akin to neural network layers—that abstract\nany particular text transformation, like answering a question or summarizing a paper. We then pa-\nrameterize each module so that it can learn its desired behavior by iteratively bootstrapping useful\ndemonstrations within the pipeline. Inspired directly by PyTorch abstractions (Paszke et al., 2019),\nDSPy modules are used via expressive define-by-run computational graphs. Pipelines are expressed\nby (1) declaring the modules needed and (2) using these modules in any logical control flow (e.g.,\nifstatements, forloops, exceptions, etc.) to logically connect the modules.\nWe then develop the DSPy compiler (Sec 4), which optimizes any DSPy program to improve quality\nor cost. The compiler inputs are the program, a few training inputs with optional labels, and a valida-\ntion metric. The compiler simulates versions of the program on the inputs and bootstraps example\ntraces of each module for self-improvement, using them to construct effective few-shot prompts\nor finetuning small LMs for steps of the pipeline. Optimization in DSPy is highly modular: it is\nconducted by teleprompters ,2which are general-purpose optimization strategies that determine how\nthe modules should learn from data. In this way, the compiler automatically maps the declarative\nmodules to high-quality compositions of prompting, finetuning, reasoning, and augmentation.\nProgramming models like DSPy could be assessed along many dimensions, but we focus on the role\nof expert-crafted prompts in shaping system performance. We are seeking to reduce or even remove\ntheir role through DSPy modules (e.g., versions of popular techniques like Chain of Thought) and\nteleprompters. We report on two expansive case studies: math word problems (GMS8K; Cobbe et al.\n2021) and multi-hop question answering (HotPotQA; Yang et al. 2018) with explorations of chain\nof thought, multi-chain reflection, multi-hop retrieval, retrieval-augmented question answering, and\nagent loops. Our evaluations use a number of different compiling strategies effectively and show\nthat straightforward DSPy programs outperform systems using hand-crafted prompts, while also\nallowing our programs to use much smaller and hence more efficient LMs effectively.\nOverall, this work proposes the first programming model that translates prompting techniques into\nparameterized declarative modules and introduces an effective compiler with general optimiza-\ntion strategies (teleprompters) to optimize arbitrary pipelines of these modules. Our main contri-\nbutions are empirical and algorithmic: with DSPy, we have found that we can implement very\nshort programs that can bootstrap self-improving multi-stage NLP systems using LMs as small as\nllama2-13b-chat andT5-Large (770M parameters). Without hand-crafted prompts and within\nminutes to tens of minutes of compiling, compositions of DSPy modules can raise the quality of\nsimple programs from 33% to 82% (Sec 6) and from 32% to 46% (Sec 7) for GPT-3.5 and, simi-\nlarly, from 9% to 47% (Sec 6) and from 22% to 41% (Sec 7) for llama2-13b-chat .\n1DSPy is pronounced dee-ess-pie . It’s the second iteration of our earlier Demonstrate–Search–Predict\nframework (DSP; Khattab et al. 2022). This paper introduces the key concepts in DSPy. For more extensive and\nup-to-date documentation of the framework, we refer readers to https://github.com/stanfordnlp/dspy .\n2We derive the name tele-prompters from the notion of abstracting and automating the task of prompting,\nin particular, such that it happens at a distance , without manual intervention.\n2\nPreprint\n2 R ELATED WORK\nThis work is inspired by the role that Torch (Collobert et al., 2002), Theano (Bergstra et al., 2010;\n2011; Al-Rfou et al., 2016), Chainer (Tokui et al., 2015), and others played in the development in\ndeep learning by providing powerful abstractions. A similar transformation is emerging with higher-\nlevel pipelines of LMs, and we are seeking to offer a solid conceptual framework and programming\nabstractions for what we call foundation model programming . We draw on differentiable program-\nming (Wang et al., 2018) but applied to LM calls rather than neural networks, and borrow syntactic\nelements from PyTorch (Paszke et al., 2019).\nIn-context learning (McCann et al. 2018; Radford et al. 2018; Brown et al. 2020) is a key mechanism\nfor foundation model programming. A growing body of work has revealed that, especially with\ninstruction tuning (Ouyang et al., 2022), we can elicit sophisticated behavior via prompting (Wei\net al., 2022; Wang et al., 2022b; Press et al., 2022; Yao et al., 2022; Khot et al., 2022; Madaan et al.,\n2023). Similarly, forms of weak supervision that would normally require task-specific (Khattab\net al., 2021a;b) or hand-built (Ratner et al., 2016; Hancock et al., 2018) heuristics are now done by\nLMs (Wang et al., 2022b; Zelikman et al., 2022; Zhang et al., 2022; Shao et al., 2023).\nIn-context learning methods now routinely invoke tools, leading to LM pipelines that use retrieval\nmodels (Chen et al., 2017; Lewis et al., 2020; Guu et al., 2020; Lazaridou et al., 2022; Izacard et al.,\n2022), multimodal foundation models, and more traditional tools like APIs (Nakano et al., 2021)\nand calculators. A number of toolkits have been developed to facilitate this, including LangChain\n(Chase, 2022), Semantic Kernel (Microsoft, 2023), LlamaIndex (Liu, 2022), and many other re-\ntrieval and agent libraries. These toolkits provide pre-packaged chains and agents that connect\nLMs with numerous accessible tools. However, they suffer from the pervasive prompt engineering\nchallenges we address in DSPy: they express task-specific behavior through hand-written prompt\ntemplates (for detailed discussion, see Appendix B).\nResearchers are starting to apply discrete optimization and RL to find effective prompts, generally\nfor a single logical LM call (Guo et al., 2023; Pryzant et al., 2023; Huang et al., 2022; Yang et al.,\n2023). DSPy seeks to generalize this space: it offers a rich framework for optimizing arbitrary\npipelines from high-level declarative signatures , by bootstrapping high-quality multi-stage demon-\nstrations with constraints. In this framework, DSPy teleprompters may apply optimization using\nmodel selection techniques like cross-validation or, in principle, with sophisticated techniques in-\nvolving RL and LM feedback (Hu et al., 2023; Zhao et al., 2023a; Shinn et al., 2023) or learned or\nBayesian hyperparameter optimization methods (Bergstra et al., 2013; Akiba et al., 2019).\nThe present paper seeks to motivate DSPy as a programming model and to report new empirical\nfindings from applying the DSPy compiler. This is inspired by formative work by Bergstra et al.\n(2010; 2013), Paszke et al. (2019), and Wolf et al. (2020), who support their respective programming\nmodels with a mix of benchmark numbers and some qualitative measures. For the current paper, we\nfocus on showing that DSPy and its compiler allow us to build outstanding LM systems without\nhand-crafted prompt strings, but instead from truly modular units, and that this opens up doors for\nsystematically exploring a rich design space at a very high programmatic level of abstraction.\n3 T HEDSP YPROGRAMMING MODEL\nWe present DSPy, which treats LMs as abstract devices for text generation,3and optimizes their us-\nage in arbitrary computational graphs. DSPy programs are expressed in Python: each program takes\nthe task input (e.g., a question to answer or a paper to summarize) and returns the output (e.g., an\nanswer or a summary) after a series of steps. DSPy contributes three abstractions toward automatic\noptimization: signatures, modules, and teleprompters. Signatures abstract the input/output behavior\nof a module; modules replace existing hand-prompting techniques and can be composed in arbitrary\npipelines; and teleprompters optimize all modules in the pipeline to maximize a metric.\n3We assume access to one or more LMs, which consume a prompt string and return text completions. This\nmay be a promptable LM capable of in-context learning (e.g., GPT-3.5 or Llama2-7b) or a smaller finetuneable\nLM (e.g., T5-base). An LM may be selected as the default; operations will use it unless configured otherwise.\n3\nPreprint\n3.1 N ATURAL LANGUAGE SIGNATURES CAN ABSTRACT PROMPTING &FINETUNING\nInstead of free-form string prompts, DSPy programs use natural language signatures to assign work\nto the LM. A DSPy signature is natural-language typed declaration of a function: a short declarative\nspec that tells DSPy what a text transformation needs to do (e.g., “consume questions and return\nanswers”), rather than how a specific LM should be prompted to implement that behavior. More\nformally, a DSPy signature is a tuple of input fields andoutput fields (and an optional instruction ).\nA field consists of field name and optional metadata.4In typical usage, the roles of fields are inferred\nby DSPy as a function of field names. For instance, the DSPy compiler will use in-context learning\nto interpret question differently from answer and will iteratively refine its usage of these fields.\nSignatures offer two benefits over prompts: they can be compiled into self-improving and pipeline-\nadaptive prompts or finetunes. This is primarily done by bootstrapping (Sec 4) useful demonstrating\nexamples for each signature. Additionally, they handle structured formatting and parsing logic to\nreduce (or, ideally, avoid) brittle string manipulation in user programs.\nIn practice, DSPy signatures can be expressed with a shorthand notation like question -> answer ,\nso that line 1 in the following is a complete DSPy program for a basic question-answering system\n(with line 2 illustrating usage and line 3 the response when GPT-3.5 is the LM):\n1qa = dspy.Predict(\"question -> answer\")\n2qa(question=\"Where is Guaran ´ı spoken?\")\n3# Out: Prediction(answer=’Guaran ´ı is spoken mainly in South America.’)\nIn the shorthand notation, each field’s name indicates the semantic role that the input (or output)\nfield plays in the transformation. DSPy will parse this notation and expand the field names into\nmeaningful instructions for the LM, so that english document -> french translation would\nprompt for English to French translation. When needed, DSPy offers more advanced programming\ninterfaces for expressing more explicit constraints on signatures (Appendix A).\n3.2 P ARAMETERIZED &TEMPLATED MODULES CAN ABSTRACT PROMPTING TECHNIQUES\nAkin to type signatures in programming languages, DSPy signatures simply define an interface and\nprovide type-like hints on the expected behavior. To use a signature, we must declare a module with\nthat signature, like we instantiated a Predict module above. A module declaration like this returns\nafunction having that signature.\nThePredict Module The core module for working with signatures in DSPy is Predict (simplified\npseudocode in Appendix D.1). Internally, Predict stores the supplied signature, an optional LM to\nuse (initially None , but otherwise overrides the default LM for this module), and a list of demon-\nstrations for prompting (initially empty). Like layers in PyTorch, the instantiated module behaves as\na callable function: it takes in keyword arguments corresponding to the signature input fields (e.g.,\nquestion ), formats a prompt to implement the signature and includes the appropriate demonstra-\ntions, calls the LM, and parses the output fields. When Predict detects it’s being used in compile\nmode, it will also internally track input/output traces to assist the teleprompter at bootstrapping the\ndemonstrations.\nOther Built-in Modules DSPy modules translate prompting techniques into modular functions that\nsupport any signature, contrasting with the standard approach of prompting LMs with task-specific\ndetails (e.g., hand-written few-shot examples). To this end, DSPy includes a number of more sophis-\nticated modules like ChainOfThought ,ProgramOfThought ,MultiChainComparison , andReAct .5\nThese can all be used interchangeably to implement a DSPy signature. For instance, simply chang-\n4String descriptions of the task and the fields are also optional and usually omitted. Fields can carry optional\nfield prefix anddescription . By default, fields are assumed to hold free-form strings; we are actively exploring\noptional data type as a way to specify constraints on valid values (e.g., bool orint) and more gracefully handle\nformatting and parsing logic, though this feature is not core to DSPy at the time of writing.\n5These modules generalize prompting techniques from the literature, respectively, by Wei et al. (2022),\nChen et al. (2022), Yoran et al. (2023), and Yao et al. (2022) and, in doing so, generalize the ideas on zero-shot\nprompting and rationale self-generation from Kojima et al. (2022), Zelikman et al. (2022), Zhang et al. (2022),\nand Huang et al. (2022) to parameterized modules that can bootstrap arbitrary multi-stage pipelines.\n4\nPreprint\ningPredict toChainOfThought in the above program leads to a system that thinks step by step\nbefore committing to its output field.\nImportantly, all of these modules are implemented in a few lines of code by expanding the user-\ndefined signature and calling Predict one or more times on new signatures as appropriate. For\ninstance, we show a simplified implementation of the built-in ChainOfThought below.\n1class ChainOfThought(dspy.Module):\n2def __init__(self, signature):\n3 # Modify signature from ‘*inputs -> *outputs‘ to ‘*inputs -> rationale, *outputs‘.\n4 rationale_field = dspy.OutputField(prefix=\"Reasoning: Let’s think step by step.\")\n5 signature = dspy.Signature(signature).prepend_output_field(rationale_field)\n6\n7 # Declare a sub-module with the modified signature.\n8 self.predict = dspy.Predict(signature)\n9\n10def forward(self, **kwargs):\n11 # Just forward the inputs to the sub-module.\n12 return self.predict(**kwargs)\nThis is a fully-fledged module capable of learning effective few-shot prompting for any LM or task.\nWe contrast that with Appendix C, which copies long reasoning prompts hand-written by sources\nranging from recent research to popular prompting libraries.\nParameterization Uniquely, DSPy parameterizes these prompting techniques. To understand this\nparameterization, observe that any LM call seeking to implement a particular signature needs to\nspecify parameters that include: (1) the specific LM to call (Chen et al., 2023), (2) the prompt in-\nstructions (Yang et al., 2023) and the string prefix of each signature field and, most importantly, (3)\nthe demonstrations used as few-shot prompts (for frozen LMs) or as training data (for finetuning).\nWe focus primarily on automatically generating and selecting useful demonstrations. In our case\nstudies, we find that bootstrapping good demonstrations gives us a powerful way to teach sophisti-\ncated pipelines of LMs new behaviors systematically.\nTools DSPy programs may use tools, which are modules that execute computation. We support re-\ntrieval models through a dspy.Retrieve module. At the time of writing, DSPy has built-in support\nfor ColBERTv2, Pyserini, and Pinecone retrievers, and we have explored experimental dspy.SQL\nfor executing SQL queries and dspy.PythonInterpreter for executing Python code in a sandbox.\nPrograms DSPy modules can be composed in arbitrary pipelines in a define-by-run interface. In-\nspired directly by PyTorch and Chainer, one first declares the modules needed at initialization, allow-\ning DSPy to keep track of them for optimization, and then one expresses the pipeline with arbitrary\ncode that calls the modules in a forward method. As a simple illustration, we offer the following\nsimple but complete retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system.\n1class RAG(dspy.Module):\n2def __init__(self, num_passages=3):\n3 # ‘Retrieve‘ will use the user’s default retrieval settings unless overriden.\n4 self.retrieve = dspy.Retrieve(k=num_passages)\n5 # ‘ChainOfThought‘ with signature that generates answers given retrieval & question.\n6 self.generate_answer = dspy.ChainOfThought(\"context, question -> answer\")\n7\n8def forward(self, question):\n9 context = self.retrieve(question).passages\n10 return self.generate_answer(context=context, question=question)\nTo highlight modularity, we use ChainOfThought as a drop-in replacement of the basic Predict .\nOne can now simply write RAG()(\"Where is Guaran ´ı spoken?\") to use it. Notice that, if we\nuse a signature \"context, question -> search query\" , we get a system that generates search\nqueries rather than answers.\n3.3 T ELEPROMPTERS CAN AUTOMATE PROMPTING FOR ARBITRARY PIPELINES\nWhen compiling a DSPy program, we generally invoke a teleprompter , which is an optimizer that\ntakes the program, a training set, and a metric—and returns a new optimized program. Different\nteleprompters (Sec 4) apply different strategies for optimization.\n5\nPreprint\nIn DSPy, training sets may be small , potentially a handful of examples, though larger data enables\nmore powerful optimization. Training examples may be incomplete , i.e., only input values are nec-\nessary. Labels for the pipeline steps are not required, unless they need to be used in the metric. In\npractice, we typically assume labels only for (at most) the program’s final output, not the intermedi-\nate steps. This label-efficiency is critical for modularity: building a new pipeline in DSPy requires\nsimply recompiling the new pipeline’s code, not annotating data specific to the new pipeline.\nMetrics can be simple notions like exact match (EM) or F1, but they can be entire DSPy programs\nthat balance multiple concerns. For example, we may compile the RAG module above against a\ndataset of question–answer pairs qatrainset and the metric EM. The goal of optimization here is\nto effectively bootstrap few-shot demonstrations. The following code achieves this:\n1# Small training set with only questions and final answers.\n2qa_trainset = [dspy.Example(question=\"What is the capital of France?\", answer=\"Paris\")]\n3\n4# The teleprompter will bootstrap missing labels: reasoning chains and retrieval contexts.\n5teleprompter = dspy.BootstrapFewShot(metric=dspy.evaluate.answer_exact_match)\n6compiled_rag = teleprompter.compile(RAG(), trainset=qa_trainset)\nIn this example, the BootstrapFewShot teleprompter (Sec 4, Appendix E.1) simulates RAGon the\ntraining example(s). It will collect demonstrations of each module (i.e., examples of its input–output\nbehavior) that collectively lead to valid output (i.e., respecting the signatures and the metric).\nIf one wanted to push the compiled program to be extractive given its retrieved contexts, one could\ndefine a custom metric to use in place of dspy.evaluate.answer exactmatch :\n1def answer_and_context_match(example, pred, trace=None):\n2answer_match = dspy.evaluate.answer_exact_match(example, pred)\n3\n4# Is the prediction a substring of some passage?\n5context_match = any((pred.answer.lower() in c) for c in pred.context)\n6\n7return answer_match and context_match\nNotice that behavior like this might be more accurately checked by another DSPy program that\nchecks for faithful grounding of answers. Such metrics are fully supported and encouraged in DSPy.\nTeleprompters can be composed by specifying a teacher program. DSPy will sample demonstra-\ntions from this program for prompt optimization. This composition can enable very rich pipelines,\nwhere expensive programs (e.g., complex expensive ensembles using large LMs) supervise cheap\nprograms (e.g., simple pipelines using smaller LMs). One may start with compiled ragfrom above\n(say, compiled to use a large Llama2-13b-chat LM) but now fine-tune Flan-T5-large to create an\nefficient program:\n1# Larger set of questions with *no labels*. Labels for all steps will be bootstrapped.\n2unlabeled_questions = [dspy.Example(question=\"What is the capital of Germany?\"), ...]\n3\n4# As we assumes no answer, we use ‘answer_passage_match‘ to filter ungrounded answers.\n5finetuning_teleprompter = BootstrapFinetune(metric=dspy.evaluate.answer_passage_match)\n6\n7# We set ‘teacher=compiled_rag‘ to compose. Bootstrapping will now use ‘compiled_rag‘.\n8compiled_rag_via_finetune = finetuning_teleprompter.compile(RAG(), teacher=compiled_rag,\ntrainset=unlabeled_questions, target=’google/flan-t5-large’)\n4 T HEDSP YCOMPILER\nA key source of DSPy’s expressive power is its ability to compile—or automatically optimize—any\nprogram in this programming model. Compiling relies on a teleprompter, which is an optimizer for\nDSPy programs that improves the quality (or cost) of modules via prompting or finetuning, which\nare unified in DSPy. While DSPy does not enforce this when creating new teleprompters, typical\nteleprompters go through three stages.\nStage 1: Candidate Generation The compiler first (recursively) finds all unique Predict modules\n(predictors) in a program, including those nested under other modules. For each unique predictor\np, the teleprompter may generate candidate values for the parameters of p: the instructions, field\ndescriptions, or—most importantly—demonstrations (i.e., example input–output pairs). In this iter-\n6\nPreprint\nation of DSPy, we focus on demonstrations and find that simple rejection-sampling-like approaches\ncan help bootstrap highly effective multi-stage systems.\nConsider the simplest non-trivial teleprompter in DSPy, BootstrapFewShot (simplified pseudocode\nin Appendix E.1). This teleprompter will simulate a teacher program (or, if unset, the zero-shot\nversion of the program being compiled) on some training inputs, possibly one or more times with\na high temperature. When running in compile mode, multi-stage traces are tracked transparently\nand in a thread-safe fashion throughout execution. The program’s metric is used to filter for multi-\nstage traces that together help the pipeline pass the metric. We thus obtain potential labels for all\nsignatures in the program by throwing away the bad examples and using the good examples as\npotential demonstrations, though these design decisions are under user control.\nWhile LMs can be highly unreliable, we find they can be rather efficient at searching the space\nof solutions for multi-stage designs. A well-decomposed program can typically find at least a few\ntraining examples where the LM can pass the constraints enforced by the signatures and metrics,\nallowing us to bootstrap iteratively if needed.\nStage 2: Parameter Optimization Now each parameter has a discrete set of candidates: demon-\nstrations, instructions, etc. Many hyperparameter tuning algorithms (e.g., random search or Tree-\nstructured Parzen Estimators as in HyperOpt (Bergstra et al., 2013) and Optuna (Akiba et al., 2019))\ncan be applied for selection among candidates. We report simplified implementations of DSPy’s\nBootstrapFewShotWithRandomSearch andBootstrapFewShotWithOptuna in Appendix E.2 and\nAppendix E.3.\nAnother type of optimization is finetuning withBootstrapFinetune , where the demonstrations are\nused to update the LM’s weights for each predictor. When this is applied, the LM parameter of each\nmodule is updated to the new LM weights. Typically, we are optimizing average quality using the\nmetric with cross-validation over the training set or a validation set. This is applicable even with no\nlabels for any stages, depending on the nature of metric.\nStage 3: Higher-Order Program Optimization A different type of optimization that the DSPy\ncompiler supports is modifying the control flow of the program. One of the simplest forms of\nthese is ensembles, which we use in the case studies in this work. An ensemble will bootstrap\nmultiple copies of the same program, and then replace the program with a new one that runs them\nall in parallel and reduces their predictions into one with a custom function (e.g., majority voting).\nIn future work, this stage can easily accommodate techniques for more dynamic (i.e., test-time)\nbootstrapping as well as automatic backtracking-like logic.\n5 G OALS OF EVALUATION\nProgramming frameworks can be evaluated along many dimensions: computational efficiency, de-\nveloper efficiency, intuitiveness of the code and concepts, and so forth. In this paper, we focus on\nperhaps the most pressing issue for current LM pipelines: the role of hand-written, task-specific\nprompts in achieving performant systems. Our evaluations seek to test the following hypotheses:\nH1With DSPy, we can replace hand-crafted prompt strings with concise and well-defined\nmodules, without reducing quality or expressive power.\nH2Parameterizing the modules and treating prompting as an optimization problem makes\nDSPy better at adapting to different LMs, and it may outperform expert-written prompts.\nH3The resulting modularity makes it possible to more thoroughly explore complex pipelines\nthat have useful performance characteristics or that fit nuanced metrics.\nOur evaluation will explore these hypotheses using diverse task–program pairs. We hope this begins\na shift from underspecified questions like “how do different LMs compare on GSM8K” toward “how\nthey compare on GSM8K with program P when compiled with strategy S”, which is a well-defined\nand reproducible run. Ultimately, our goal is to reduce the role of artful prompt construction in\nmodern AI in favor of the development of new modular, composable programs and optimizers.\n7\nPreprint\nTable 1: Results with in-context learning on GSM8K math word problems. Each row represents\na separate pipeline: the module in the Program column is compiled against the examples in the\nTraining set. The programs, compilers, and (small) training sets are defined in Section 6. Rows with\nensemble build on the immediately preceding row. Notably, all programs in this table are expressed\nby composing two to four DSPy modules and teleprompters. Compiling the correct modules , instead\nof string prompts, improves different LMs from 4–20% accuracy to 49–88% accuracy.\nGPT-3.5 Llama2-13b-chat\nProgram Compilation Training Dev Test Dev Test\nvanillanone n/a 24.0 25.2 7.0 9.4\nfewshot trainset 33.1 – 4.3 –\nbootstrap trainset 44.0 – 28.0 –\nbootstrap ×2trainset 64.7 61.7 37.3 36.5\n+ensemble trainset 62.7 61.9 39.0 34.6\nCoTnone n/a 50.0 – 26.7 –\nfewshot trainset 63.0 – 27.3 –\nfewshot +humanCoT 78.6 72.4 34.3 33.7\nbootstrap trainset 80.3 72.9 43.3 –\n+ensemble trainset 88.3 81.6 43.7 –\nreflectionnone n/a 65.0 – 36.7 –\nfewshot trainset 71.7 – 36.3 –\nbootstrap trainset 83.0 76.0 44.3 40.2\n+ensemble trainset 86.7 – 49.0 46.9\n6 C ASE STUDY : M ATH WORD PROBLEMS\nWe evaluate on the popular GSM8K dataset with grade school math questions (Cobbe et al., 2021).\nWe sample 200 and 300 question–answer pairs from the official training set for training and develop-\nment, respectively. Our final evaluations use the 1.3k official test set examples. We report extensive\ncomparisons on the development set to avoid overfitting on test. Following prior work on GSM8K,\nwe evaluate the accuracy of the final numerical value that appears in the LM output.\nPrograms Considered For this task, we consider three simple DSPy programs: a one-step Pre-\ndict module ( vanilla ), a two-step ChainOfThought module ( CoT), and finally a multi-stage Com-\nparerOfThoughts module ( ThoughtReflection ). These are fully defined by the following code:\n1vanilla = dspy.Predict(\"question -> answer\") # GSM8K Program ‘vanilla‘\n2\n3CoT = dspy.ChainOfThought(\"question -> answer\") # GSM8K Program ‘CoT‘\n1class ThoughtReflection(dspy.Module):\n2def __init__(self, num_attempts):\n3 self.predict = dspy.ChainOfThought(\"question -> answer\", n=num_attempts)\n4 self.compare = dspy.MultiChainComparison(’question -> answer’, M=num_attempts)\n5\n6def forward(self, question):\n7 completions = self.predict(question=question).completions\n8 return self.compare(question=question, completions=completions)\n9\n10reflection = ThoughtReflection(num_attempts=5) # GSM8K Program ‘reflection‘\nInreflection , five reasoning chains are sampled from the LM (alongside their answers) and they\nare compared in parallel by a built-in MultiChainComparison module, which generalizes Yoran\net al. (2023). This generates a new answer taking into account the patterns from the five attempts.\nCritically, the modules used are all generic, none is specific math problems or particular LM.\nCompiling As we discussed in Section 4, DSPy programs can be compiled into new, optimized\nprograms. In our experiments, we evaluate the programs zero-shot (no compiling) as well as a\nnumber of strategies for compiling. Our simplest compiler is LabeledFewShot :\n1fewshot = dspy.LabeledFewShot(k=8).compile(program, trainset=trainset)\nHere,program can be any DSPy module. This simply samples k=8random demonstrations from the\ntrainset for the fields common to the training examples and the signature(s), in this case, question\nandanswer , but not the reasoning for instance. We report the average of 3–5 runs (depending on the\nsetting) when applying such random sampling.\n8\nPreprint\nNext, we also consider bootstrapping few-shot examples with random search:\n1tp = BootstrapFewShotWithRandomSearch(metric=gsm8k_accuracy)\n2bootstrap = tp.compile(program, trainset=trainset, valset=devset)\nThis will generate demonstration chains for examples in the training set and optimize the selection\nof demonstrations (from this set) to self-improve the program’s modules. As the name indicates, this\nis done with random search, treating the selection of demonstrations as a parameter to optimize.\nNext, if desired, this bootstrapping process can be nested in DSPy. In particular, we can use the\noptimized bootstrap program itself to further bootstrap another program. This is relevant, for\nexample, whenever the original zero-shot program performs relatively poorly.\n1bootstrap2 = tp.compile(program, teacher=bootstrap, trainset=trainset, valset=devset)\nAnd lastly, we consider ensembling these bootstraps:\n1# A program that ensembles the top-7 candidate programs from a bootstrapping compiler run\n(in particular ‘bootstrap‘ or, when applicable, ‘bootstrap2‘) with majority voting.\n2ensemble = Ensemble(reduce_fn=dspy.majority).compile(bootstrap.programs[:7])\nGSM8K includes human reasoning chains. Above, trainset does not include these reasoning\nchains. We also evaluate with trainset humanCoT, which extends the examples in trainset with\nthe human reasoning string. These two datasets can be used interchangeably as the value for the\ntrainset parameter above. We note here that compiling generally runs on the order of minutes\n(or tens of minutes) as even the more expensive settings only require running the program a few\nthousand times (e.g., 10–20 trials over 150–300 validation examples) and they can occur in parallel.\nResults Our results are summarized in Table 1, which includes dev results as well as our evaluation\nof promising representatives of each approach on the test set. First, the vanilla program results\nshow that GPT-3.5 andllama2-13b-chat struggle with math word problems when they have to\npredict the answers directly, that is, without using a reasoning chain first. This is most pronounced\nin the absence of good demonstrations, which can be seen in the none compilation setting (i.e.,\nzero-shot instruction) and the fewshot setting (i.e., sampling random question–answer pairs). In-\nterestingly, however, vanilla is helped substantially by compiling with bootstrap and by iterating\nthis process into bootstrap ×2. On inspecting the prompts bootstrapped (Appendix F), we see that\nthe prompt allows the LM to leverage the answer field for reasoning first, which is permitted as the\nmetric extracts the final numerical value for evaluation.\nNext, we consider the CoTprogram. While the expert human reasoning chains ( +humanCoT) provide\na large boost when available, we can match or surpass this using bootstrap , substantiating our\nhypothesis that DSPy can cut the need for hand-crafted prompts. Beyond this, we see that the\nreflection program, while only a few lines longer than the others, is a clear winner, though CoTis\nquite effective with ensemble . Overall, the bootstrap compilation procedure leads to large gains\nfor every program, across both LMs. Indeed, all programs in this table are expressed by composing\ntwo to four DSPy modules and teleprompters, and they reveal overall that—in the new paradigm\nprescribed by DSPy—it’s composing the right generic modules , rather than manipulating string\nprompts, that improves different LMs from 4–20% accuracy to 49–88% accuracy.\nWe can informally compare with the following. Zhang et al. (2022) reports 48% for\ntext-davinci-002 , which aligns closely with our llama2-13b-chat results, and reports 59.4%\nwith codex when employing a manual CoT approach and 62.8% with an automatic CoT method.\nWang et al. (2022b) report 57% for CoT prompting with PaLM 540-B, which becomes 74% upon\nadding self-consistency. The Llama2 authors (Touvron et al., 2023) presents 28.7% for llama2-13b ,\n42.2% for llama2-34b , and 56.8% for llama2-70b . Intriguingly, our program with the 13b variant\nof the model is competitive with their 34b-based results even though we don’t use human reasoning\nchains in our program. Zhao et al. (2023b) reports 80.8% for CoT with gpt-3.5-turbo from April\n2023. The GPT-4 authors (OpenAI, 2023) reports that GPT-3.5 scores 57.1% and GPT-4 elevates\nthis to 92% but they note that GPT-4 was in fact pre-trained on a subset of GSM8K’s training set.\n9\nPreprint\n7 C ASE STUDY : COMPLEX QUESTION ANSWERING\nIn this case study, we explore the multi-hop question answering task with the HotPotQA (Yang et al.,\n2018) dataset in the open-domain “fullwiki” setting. For retrieval, we use a search index of the of-\nficial Wikipedia 2017 “abstracts” dump of HotPotQA. Search is conducted by a ColBERTv2 (San-\nthanam et al., 2021) retriever. The HotPotQA test set is hidden, so we reserve the official validation\nset for our testing, and sample 1000 examples for that. We sub-divide the training set into 70%/30%\ntrain/validation splits. In the training (and thus validation) split, we keep only examples marked as\n“hard” in the original dataset, which matches the designation of the official validation and test sets.\nFor training and for reporting development results, we sample 200 and 300 examples respectively.\nPrograms Considered Our simplest baseline is the vanilla program used in the previous case\nstudy on GSM8K (Sec 6); the \"question -> answer\" signature is universal enough that it will\nwork for this task (and many others) when compiled appropriately.\nOur baseline RAG program is the one given in Section 3.2 as a simple example of RAG with a\ndspy.ChainOfThought layer. We will see that this program does not excel at HotPotQA, and this\nmotivates us to evaluate two multi-hop programs.\nTo that end, we first test ReAct (Yao et al., 2022), a multi-step agent for tool use, which is imple-\nmented as a built-in module in DSPy. In the simplest case, a ReAct module for a particular signature\ncan be declared as follows in DSPy:\n1react = dspy.ReAct(\"question -> answer\", tools=[dspy.Retrieve(k=1)], max_iters=5)\nWe also test the following custom program, which simulates the information flow in Baleen (Khattab\net al., 2021a) and IRRR (Qi et al., 2020) and has similarities to IRCoT (Trivedi et al., 2022).\n1class BasicMultiHop(dspy.Module):\n2def __init__(self, passages_per_hop):\n3 self.retrieve = dspy.Retrieve(k=passages_per_hop)\n4 self.generate_query = dspy.ChainOfThought(\"context, question -> search_query\")\n5 self.generate_answer = dspy.ChainOfThought(\"context, question -> answer\")\n6\n7def forward(self, question):\n8 context = []\n9\n10 for hop in range(2):\n11 query = self.generate_query(context=context, question=question).search_query\n12 context += self.retrieve(query).passages\n13\n14 return self.generate_answer(context=context, question=question)\n15\n16multihop = BasicMultiHop(passages_per_hop=3)\nCompiling For compilers, we continue to use the ones that we used for GSM8K (see Sec 6). We\nalso consider two compositions of our teleprompters. For ReAct, we consider bootstrapping with\nBootstrapFewShotWithRandomSearch starting from an earlier bootstrap of the ReAct program.\nFor the simple multihop program, we also consider fine-tuning with T5-Large starting from the\nearlier bootstrap of that program.\n1multihop_t5 = dspy.BootstrapFinetune(metric=answer_exact_match).compile(program,\nteacher=bootstrap, trainset=trainset, target=’t5-large’)\nResults Table 2 summarizes our results. Compared with the vanilla few-shot prompting, a chain-\nof-thought and retrieval-augmented generation ( CoTRAG) program can self-bootstrap in DSPy to\nincrease answer EM substantially. However, this relies entirely on the ColBERTv2 retriever to find\nrelevant passages directly from the original questions, limiting its passage recall. This is tackled in\nthereact andmultihop programs, which will generate queries for the retriever in multiple iterative\n“hops”. Indeed, overall, a simple multihop program performs the best, and in general bootstrap\nagain proves to be very effective at raising its quality relative to its fewshot variant for both LMs.\nIn particular, we can see that bootstrap (and/orbootstrap ×2) can outperform both fewshot\nprompting (for multihop ) and expert human reasoning (for react ; adapted slightly from Yao et al.\n(2022) to our retrieval setting). Perhaps most importantly, we can make llama2-13b-chat compet-\nitive with GPT-3.5 by simply compiling our programs.\nTo assess the finetuning capacity of DSPy, we also evaluated the compiler multihop t5defined\nabove which produces a T5-Large (770M parameter) model. This program scores 39.3% answer\nEM and 46.0% passage accuracy on the dev set, using only 200 labeled inputs and 800 unlabeled\n10\nPreprint\nTable 2: Results with in-context learning on HotPotQA multi-hop retrieval question answering.

Using CoT prompting, Si et al. (2022) achieve 25.2% EM. With a “recite-and-answer” tech-\nnique that uses PaLM-62B (Chowdhery et al., 2022) to recite evidence passages, Sun et al. (2022)\nachieve 26.5% EM. Wang et al. (2022a) achieve 33.8% EM and 44.6% F1 when applying self-\nconsistency for PaLM-540B. Yao et al. (2022) achieve 27.4% EM using ReAct with PaLM-540B\nand 30.8 with text-davinci-002 , with a tool giving it the ability for search using a Wikipedia\nAPI. They push their PaLM results to 35.1% EM by applying an additional CoT step with self-\nconsistency, which may resemble our ensemble approach in the sense of aggregating multiple an-\nswers. Trivedi et al. (2022) reports 49% using a pipeline with code-davinci-002 LM on a sample\nof 500 HotPotQA questions.\n8 C ONCLUSION\nThis paper introduced DSPy, a new programming model for designing AI systems using pipelines\nof pretrained LMs and other tools. We presented three new concepts introduced in this abstraction\n(DSPy signatures, modules, and teleprompters), and showed in two very different case studies that\nit supports rapid development of highly effective systems that use relatively small LMs. We have\nmaintained open-source versions of this framework for close to a year. In this period, we have seen\nand created a large number of programs that were compiled to high-quality systems by DSPy, span-\nning tasks from information extraction to low-resource synthetic data generation. In the interest of\nspace and to maintain reasonable scope in this paper, we leave reporting on such tasks under con-\ntrolled experimental conditions to future work. While in-context learning has proved transformative\nover the past 2–3 years of LM research, we argue that the true expressive power in this emerging\nparadigm is in building sophisticated text transformation graphs in which composable modules and\noptimizers (teleprompters) come together to leverage LMs in more systematic and reliable ways.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe thank Josh Purtell for suggesting the apt name “text transformation graph” for the computational\ngraph abstraction of DSPy.

For\ninstance, the following signature generates search queries using context and an optional question:\n1class GenerateSearchQuery(dspy.Signature):\n2\"\"\"Write a simple search query that will help answer a complex question.\"\"\"\n3\n4context = dspy.InputField(desc=\"may contain relevant facts\")\n5question = dspy.InputField()\n6query = dspy.OutputField(dtype=dspy.SearchQuery)\nUsing the above, we can specify a complete system for the generation of a synthetic IR dataset where\nthe queries are mediated by a question generated by the LM:\n1query_gen = dspy.Predict(GenerateSearchQuery)\n2query_gen(context=\"Language typology\")\n3# Out: Prediction(question=’What are the main types of language classification?’,\nquery=’\"language classification\" OR \"language typology\" -wikipedia’)\nIf questions are available, they can be supplied as shown: querygen(context=\"Language\ntypology\", question=\"What are the primary language families of South America?\") .\nAs a work in progress feature, users can optionally specify the type of output fields as bool, int,\nfloat, list , ordict instead of the default free-form string type, as in contexts, question ->\nanswerfound: bool .\nB C OMPARISON WITH EXISTING LIBRARIES LIKE LANG CHAIN AND\nLLAMA INDEX\nLangChain and LlamaIndex are perhaps the most popular library in the general space of prompting\nLMs. These libraries have a different focus compared to DSPy and they suffer internally from the\nprompt engineering challenges that DSPy aims to resolve. In particular, whereas the goal of DSPy\nis to tackle the fundamental challenges of prompt engineering for building new LM computational\ngraphs, LangChain and LlamaIndex generally help application developers who need pre-packaged\ncomponents and chains, e.g., implementations of popular and reusable pipelines (e.g., particular\nagents and specific retrieval pipelines) and tools (e.g., connections to various databases and imple-\nmentations of long- and short-term memory for agents).\nThese off-the-shelf higher-level abstractions contrast with DSPy’s focus on introducing core com-\nposable operators. In particular, DSPy introduces signatures (to abstract prompts), modules (to\nabstract prompting techniques), and teleprompters to act as optimizers for arbitrary imperative code\n(DSPy programs) that chain modules together. Its goal is to help researchers and practitioners\nbuild new LM pipelines quickly and achieve very high quality through automatic compilation (self-\nimprovement) instead of manual prompt engineering.\nIn contrast, typical existing research implementations and existing libraries like LangChain and\nLlamaIndex are implemented using manual prompt engineering, which is the key problem that DSPy\ntackles. We conducted an informal study to highlight this. In late September 2023, we found\nthat the LangChain codebase contains 50 strings exceeding 1000 characters, which are generally\nprompts, compared to none at all in DSPy. Indeed, a substantial number of LangChain’s Python\nfiles are singularly dedicated to task-related templating and prompt engineering with 12 prompts.py\nfiles and and 42 prompt.py files. DSPy, on the other hand, provides a structured framework that\nautomatically bootstraps prompts. The library itself does not contain a single hand-written prompt\ndemonstration for any tasks at the time of writing, despite the very high quality with various LMs.\nTo review the typical forms of prompt engineering in existing libraries, we consider the follow-\ning in LangChain. The LangChain Program-Aided Language Model Gao et al. (2023a) chain pro-\ngram uses few-shot learning, leveraging a template that is 3982 characters long with 8 math word\nproblems (Prompt 2) and corresponding outputted programs as learning examples for the language\nmodel. LangChain also contains a prompt for SQL query tasks for each of the databases like Or-\nacle, GoogleSQL, DuckDB, Crate, and MySQL, with the average length of these prompts at 1058\ncharacters. Other task areas such as QA with sources (Prompt B) and Graph QA also have signif-\n17\nPreprint\nicantly lengthy prompt templates, with averages of 1337 and 722 characters, respectively. While\nexpert-written prompts can be useful, we believe that LM- and task-adaptive prompts bootstrapped\nautomatically can offer far more power (and are far more modular) than hard-coding a prompt per\ndatabase provider inside the code base. The next appendix section contains a number of prompts\ncopied from related research papers and existing libraries.\nC S AMPLE LARGE PROMPTS\nThis section highlights a few popular existing frameworks that structure prompts with extensive\nprompt engineering templates. The primary objective is to capture how many words and characters\nare used for such large multi-line prompts defined for tasks or tools and present these example\nprompts retrieved from open-sourced papers and repositories. The formatting of these example\nprompts is adapted from Gao et al. (2023a).\nTask/Tool Prompt Source Words Characters\nPrompt 1: Text-evidence checker Gao et al.

It’s called the nasal cycle.\n4 I checked: How often do your nostrils switch?\n5 I found this article: Although we don’t usually notice it, during the nasal cycle one nostril becomes congested and thus\ncontributes less to airflow, while the other becomes decongested. On average, the congestion pattern switches about every\n2 hours, according to a small 2016 study published in the journal PLOS One.\n6 Your nose’s switching time is about every 2 hours, not 45 minutes.\n7 This disagrees with what you said.\n8\n9 (2) You said: The Little House books were written by Laura Ingalls Wilder.

No additional stimulus payments. Unlike 2020 and 2021, there were no new stimulus\npayments for 2022 so taxpayers should not expect to get an additional payment.\n9 Some tax credits return to 2019 levels. This means that taxpayers will likely receive a significantly smaller refund\ncompared with the previous tax year. Changes include amounts for the Child Tax Credit (CTC), the Earned Income Tax Credit\n(EITC) and the Child and Dependent Care Credit will revert to pre-COVID levels.\n10 For 2022, the CTC is worth $2,000 for each qualifying child. A child must be under age 17 at the end of 2022 to be a\nqualifying child. For the EITC, eligible taxpayers with no children will get $560 for the 2022 tax year. The Child and\nDependent Care Credit returns to a maximum of $2,100 in 2022.\n11 No above-the-line charitable deductions. During COVID, taxpayers were able to take up to a $600 charitable donation tax\ndeduction on their tax returns. However, for tax year 2022, taxpayers who don’t itemize and who take the standard deduction,\nwon’t be able to deduct their charitable contributions.\n12 More people may be eligible for the Premium Tax Credit. For tax year 2022, taxpayers may qualify for temporarily expanded\neligibility for the premium tax credit.\n13 Eligibility rules changed to claim a tax credit for clean vehicles. Review the changes under the Inflation Reduction Act\nof 2022 to qualify for a Clean Vehicle Credit.\nFigure 8: LlamaIndex example prompt for IRS chatbot guidelines.\n26\nPreprint\nD M ODULES\nD.1 P REDICT\n1class Predict(dspy.Module):\n2def __init__(self, signature, **config):\n3 self.signature = dspy.Signature(signature)\n4 self.config = config\n5\n6 # Module Parameters.\n7 self.lm = dspy.ParameterLM(None) # use the default LM\n8 self.demonstrations = dspy.ParameterDemonstrations([])\n9\n10def forward(self, **kwargs):\n11 lm = get_the_right_lm(self.lm, kwargs)\n12 signature = get_the_right_signature(self.signature, kwargs)\n13 demonstrations = get_the_right_demonstrations(self.demonstrations, kwargs)\n14\n15 prompt = signature(demos=self.demos, **kwargs)\n16 completions = lm.generate(prompt, **self.config)\n17 prediction = Prediction.from_completions(completions, signature=signature)\n18\n19 if dsp.settings.compiling is not None:\n20 trace = dict(predictor=self, inputs=kwargs, outputs=prediction)\n21 dspy.settings.traces.append(trace)\n22\n23 return prediction\nD.2 C HAIN OF THOUGHT\n1class ChainOfThought(dspy.Module):\n2def __init__(self, signature):\n3\n4 # Modify signature from ‘*inputs -> *outputs‘ to ‘*inputs -> rationale, *outputs‘.\n5 rationale_field = dspy.OutputField(prefix=\"Reasoning: Let’s think step by step.\")\n6 signature = dspy.Signature(signature).prepend_output_field(rationale_field)\n7\n8 # Declare a sub-module with the modified signature.\n9 self.predict = dspy.Predict(self.signature)\n10\n11def forward(self, **kwargs):\n12 # Just forward the inputs to the sub-module.\n13 return self.predict(**kwargs)\n27\nPreprint\nE T ELEPROMPTERS\nE.1 B OOTSTRAP FEWSHOT\n1class SimplifiedBootstrapFewShot(Teleprompter):\n2def __init__(self, metric=None):\n3 self.metric = metric\n4\n5def compile(self, student, trainset, teacher=None):\n6 teacher = teacher if teacher is not None else student\n7 compiled_program = student.deepcopy()\n8\n9 # Step 1.

We know\nthat he needs to let it rise for 120 minutes twice, so that’s 240 minutes. Then, he needs to spend 10 minutes kneading it\nand 30 minutes baking it.

We know that he had\n$2000 to begin with, and he spent $600 on goods from his supplier, so he has $2000 - $600 = $1400 left. Then, his debtor\npaid him $800, so he has $1400 + $800 = $2200. Finally, he spent $1200 on equipment maintenance, so he has $2200 - $1200\n=$1000 left.\n21 Answer: $1000 ---\n22\n23 ---\n24\n25 ... several other demonstrations here ...\n26\n27 ---\n28\n29 Question:\nFigure 10: Shortened copy of the prompt automatically generated by DSPy for GSM8K Llama2-\n13b-chat CoT program compiled with bootstrap .\n31\nPreprint\n1 Given the fields ‘context‘, ‘question‘, produce the fields ‘search query‘.\n2\n3 ---\n4\n5 Follow the following format.\n6\n7 Context: ${context }\n8 Question: ${question }\n9 Reasoning: Let’s think step by step in order to ${produce the search query }.

Prior work has demon-\nstrated their effectiveness at performing a variety of tasks, including\ncode completion, summarization, translation, and lookup [4, 5, 18,\n20,21,26,40]. Popular models such as StarCoder [ 29], span a wide\nrange of programming languages and domains, and can be used to\ncomplete or generate code during the development process. This\nmakes them a promising tool for improving developer productivity\nand the overall quality of software. However, despite the rapid ad-\nvancement and scaling of LLMs in recent years, they still struggle\nwith more complicated tasks such as reasoning and planning. One\nparticularly complex task that LLMs struggle with is generating\nparallel code. This task involves reasoning about data distributions,\nparallel algorithms, and parallel programming models.\nParallel code is essential to modern software development due\nto the ubiquity of multi-core processors, GPGPUs, and distributed\nsystems. However, writing parallel code is difficult and error-prone.\nParallel algorithms are generally more complicated than their se-\nquential counterparts, and parallel bugs such as race conditions and\ndeadlocks are notoriously non-trivial to debug. Further, it can be\nchallenging to reason about the performance of parallel code and\nidentify “performance bugs” [ 25]. LLMs can potentially help devel-\nopers overcome these challenges but, this requires an understanding\nof the current capabilities of LLMs, and in turn, a well-designed\nand reproducible methodology to assess these capabilities.\nThere are several existing benchmarks for evaluating the capa-\nbilities of LLMs to generate correct code. However, none of them\ntest generation of parallel code. Most existing benchmarks focus on\nshort, array or string manipulation tasks, and are predominantly in\nPython (or translated to other languages from Python [ 9]). Only\nmore recent benchmarks such as DS-1000 [ 28], test the usage of\nAPIs, which are critical to using parallel programming models. Fur-\nther, these benchmarks do not evaluate the performance of the\ngenerated code, instead testing only correctness. While correctness\nis a crucial metric, performance is also vital for developers writing\nparallel code. Thus, it is imperative to design new benchmarks\nand metrics to evaluate the usefulness of LLMs for parallel code\ngeneration tasks.\nDeveloping a set of benchmarks that fully covers the space of de-\nsired capabilities is non-trivial. Identifying the best LLM for parallel\n281\n\nHPDC ’24, June 3–7, 2024, Pisa, Italy Nichols et al.\ncode generation requires testing on problems that cover shared-\nand distributed-memory programming models, different computa-\ntional problem types, and different parallel algorithms. This can\nbecome a large quantity of benchmarks that must be manually\ndesigned. Further, these benchmarks are challenging to test. Tradi-\ntional Python code generation benchmarks are tested by running\neval on the generated code for a small number of small unit tests.\nOn the other hand, in the case of parallel code — we must compile\nC/C++ code, link against one or more parallel libraries, and run the\ncode in the proper parallel environment. Additionally, if we want\nto test the performance of the generated code, then we must choose\nreasonable input sizes for each benchmark.\nIn order to evaluate the current capabilities and limitations of\nLLMs in generating parallel code, we propose the Parallel Code\nGeneration Evaluation (ParEval) benchmark: a set of benchmarks\n(prompts) for evaluating how well LLMs generate parallel code.\nThese benchmarks cover twelve different computational problem\ntypes, and seven different execution models: serial, OpenMP, Kokkos,\nMPI, MPI+OpenMP, CUDA, and HIP. We evaluate several state-of-\nthe-art open- and closed-source LLMs using these benchmarks, and\nreport metrics that represent the correctness andperformance of the\ngenerated code. We introduce novel code generation evaluation\nmetrics that assess performance and parallel scaling. We further\nanalyze how each model performs with respect to the various pro-\ngramming models and computational problem types. We discuss the\nareas where current state-of-the-art LLMs are already performing\nwell and the areas where they can be improved.\nIn this paper, we make the following important contributions:\n•We design the ParEval benchmark for evaluating the ability\nof LLMs to generate and translate parallel code. ParEval is\navailable online at: github.com/parallelcodefoundry/ParEval.\n•We introduce two novel metrics, speedup 𝑛@k and\nefficiency 𝑛@k, for evaluating the performance and scaling\nof LLM generated code.\n•We evaluate the effectiveness of several state-of-the-art open-\nand closed-source LLMs using the ParEval benchmark.\n•We identify several areas where current state-of-the-art\nLLMs can improve their capabilities on parallel code genera-\ntion.\nIn addition to these contributions, we explore the following\nresearch questions (answers based on our observations):\nRQ1 How well do state-of-the-art LLMs generate parallel code, and\nwhich models are the best? We show that all tested LLMs,\nboth open- and closed-source, struggle to generate parallel\ncode. Of the models tested, GPT-3.5 performs the best with\na pass@1 of 76.0 for serial code generation and a pass@1 of\n39.6 for parallel code generation.\nRQ2 Which parallel execution models and problem types are most\nchallenging for LLMs? We observe that LLMs struggle most\nwith MPI code generation, and perform best for OpenMP\nand Kokkos code generation. Additionally, we show that\nLLMs find it challenging to generate parallel code for sparse,\nunstructured problems.\nRQ3 How performant and scalable is the parallel code generated by\nLLMs? We observe that the parallel code generated by LLMs\ncan have poor parallel speedup and efficiency. Additionally,we show that the LLMs that most often generate correct par-\nallel code do not necessarily generate the most performant\nparallel code.\nRQ4 How well can LLMs translate between execution models? How\nperformant and scalable is the translated code? We show that\nproviding LLMs with correct implementations in one exe-\ncution model can improve their ability to generate correct\ncode in another execution model. This is particularly true\nfor smaller open-source models.\n2 BACKGROUND\nIn this section, we provide background information on large lan-\nguage models and how they are used for text generation. We further\ndiscuss how large language models can be used for code generation.\n2.1 Large Language Models\nNatural Language Processing (NLP) has largely been dominated\nby transformer-based models since their introduction in 2017 by\nVaswani et al. [ 47]. Transformer networks are designed to model se-\nquential data, such as text, relying on self-attention mechanisms to\nmodel the relationships between values in a sequence. Self-attention\nenables modeling of long-range dependencies in the data with-\nout vanishing gradient and scaling issues and allows for sequence\nelements to processed in parallel. Transformers learn attention\nscores, which are computed between pairs of tokens in the input.\nMulti-head attention allows for learning multiple attention repre-\nsentations. These large transformer models are generally trained\nto model the distribution of a text corpus such as the English lan-\nguage by predicting the next token in a sequence given previous\ntokens. Transformer-based models have emerged as the most ef-\nfective means of modeling text data, and have been shown to be\neffective at a wide range of NLP tasks.\n2.2 Large Language Models for Code\nAn LLM trained on a large corpus of code can be used to generate\ncode by giving it a code input prompt and asking it to predict the\nnext token. Generally, code LLMs are trained on a large corpus of\ncode, such as The Stack [ 27], that covers a wide range of program-\nming languages and application types. Sometimes the pre-training\ncorpus includes natural language as well, such as The Pile [ 16,49].\nIn some instances, such as CodeLlama [ 41], the code LLM is a natu-\nral language model that has been further fine-tuned on a corpus of\ncode. When generating code with one of these models it is often not\nenough to simply select the most probable next token to construct\na sequence. This often leads to repetitive, low-quality outputs [ 22],\nso we also need a strategy for token selection. We utilize nucleus\nsampling andmodel temperature in this study.\nNucleus Sampling. Nucleus sampling [ 22], also called top-p sam-\npling, samples the next token from the token probability distribu-\ntion up to some cut-off 𝑝in the cumulative distribution function.\nCompared to sampling from a fixed number of top tokens in the\ndistribution (called top-k sampling), this ensures the selection of\na more representative sample of tokens from the distribution. Nu-\ncleus sampling is often used in code generation tasks with a value\nof𝑝=0.95and is sometimes combined with top- 𝑘sampling.\n282\nCan Large Language Models Write Parallel Code? HPDC ’24, June 3–7, 2024, Pisa, Italy\nModel Temperature. Generation temperature is a scaling value ap-\nplied to the raw model outputs, or logits, before they are converted\nto a probability distribution. The value is applied by first dividing\nthe logits vector by the scalar temperature before computing the\nsoftmax of the logits. Higher temperatures make the probability\ndistribution more peaked, upweighting the most probably tokens,\nwhile lower temperatures make the distribution more uniform. In-\ntuitively, lower temperatures yield more conservative generations\nthat the model is more confident in. Conversely, higher tempera-\ntures will lead to more varied and creative generations. For code\ngeneration tasks, a low temperature value of 0.2is often used.\n3 RELATED WORK\nBelow, we describe related work in benchmarking LLMs for code-\nrelated tasks and applying LLMs to parallel and HPC code.\n3.1 Benchmarking LLMs for Code-related\nTasks\nSince the introduction of the Codex model and HumanEval bench-\nmark [ 13], many works have proposed new LLMs for code and\nevaluated them on a variety of tasks. The number of code-specific\nmodels has grown rapidly as open-source models and data sets\nbecome more available and low-rank training techniques, such\nas LoRA [ 23], make training large models more feasible. These\nmodels are usually evaluated on code generation tasks such as\nHumanEval [13], MBPP [7], and DS-1000 [28].\nThe first of these, HumanEval [ 13], is a set of 164 code generation\ntasks that are designed to evaluate the ability of LLMs to write short\nPython functions that solve a variety of problems, given a docstring\nand function signature. Similar to HumanEval is the Mostly Basic\nPython Problems (MBPP) [ 7] benchmark which is a set of 1000\nsimple Python problems. MBPP is often evaluated with few-shot\nprompts, where example correct solutions to other problems are\nincluded in the prompts. A common extension of these benchmarks\nis MultiPL-E [ 9] which extends the set of HumanEval and MBPP\ntests to 18 programming languages.\nThe DS-1000 benchmark [ 28] tests the ability of the model to gen-\nerate more complex, data science-related code, for 1000 tasks mak-\ning use of common data science libraries. Other similar benchmarks\nthat evaluate coding LLMs on more complex tasks are GSM8K [ 14]\nand GSM-HARD [ 17], which use PAL [ 17] to evaluate the ability\nof LLMs to generate Python code snippets to assist in chains of\nreasoning. The CoderEval benchmarks [ 50] are a set of 230 Java and\n230 Python code generation tasks that require the model to write\ncontext-dependent functions, rather than standalone functions as\nin HumanEval and MBPP.\nAdditionally, there have been several domain specific bench-\nmarks that evaluate more narrow uses of LLM code generation [ 15,\n30,43]. All of these benchmarks make use of tasks manually created\nby experts to test more specific use cases of LLMs.\n3.2 Applying LLMs to Parallel and HPC Code\nRecently there has been a growing interest in applying LLMs to par-\nallel and High Performance Computing (HPC) code. Several works\nhave looked at creating smaller specialized HPC models [ 24,32] or\napplying existing LLMs to HPC tasks [ 10,11,31]. Nichols et al. [ 32]introduce HPCCoder, a model fine-tuned on HPC code, and evalu-\nate its ability to generate HPC code, label OpenMP pragmas, and\npredict performance. Kadosh et al. [ 24] introduce TOKOMPILER, an\nHPC specific tokenizer for LLMs, and use it to train COMPCODER,\na model trained on C, C++, and Fortran code.\nOther works have looked at applying existing LLMs to HPC tasks.\nMunley et al. [ 31] evaluate the ability of LLMs to generate compiler\nverification tests for parallel OpenACC code. Chen et al. [ 10] use\nLLMs to identify data races in parallel code and propose the DRB-\nML data set, which is integrated into the LM4HPC framework [ 11].\nGodoy et al. [ 19] and Valero-Lara et al. [ 46] both evaluate the\ncapabilities of LLMs on generating HPC kernels, but use a limited\nset of problems and LLMs and do not prompt or evaluate the LLMs\nusing standard practices. None of these works comprehensively\nevaluate and compare the ability of LLMs to generate parallel code\nacross a large number of problems, execution models, and LLMs\nusing state-of-the-art evaluation techniques, which is the focus of\nthis work.\n4PAREVAL: PROMPTS FOR PARALLEL CODE\nGENERATION\nIn order to evaluate the ability of LLMs to generate parallel code, we\npropose the Parallel Code Generation Evaluation (ParEval) bench-\nmark. Below, we discuss the design of ParEval, and its various\ncomponents that lead to the creation of concrete prompts for LLMs.\nTo disambiguate the use of the terms prompt, task, problem, prob-\nlem type, and benchmark we define them as follows.\n•Task/Prompt: An individual text prompt that is given to the LLM\nto generate code. The output can be compiled, executed, and\nscored as either correct or incorrect code.\n•Problem: A set of tasks or prompts that test the ability of the LLM\nto generate code for the same computational work, but each task\nor prompt may use a different execution model.\n•Problem Type: A set of problems that test computational problems\nwith similar work or from similar domains (for example, sorting\nproblems).\n•Benchmark: A set of prompts that are all tested together to evalu-\nate the performance of the LLM. We name the collection of all\nthe prompts we have designed as the ParEval benchmark.\nBenchmark Requirements. The goal of ParEval is to evaluate\nthe ability of LLMs to generate parallel code. To do this, the prompts\nshould be such that:\n(1)The prompts should cover a wide variety of computational\nproblem types, and parallel programming models.\n(2)The prompts should be simple enough that they can be gener-\nated as a standalone function, but complex enough that they\nare not too trivial to solve.\n(3)The prompts should not exist within any of the LLMs’ training\ndatasets, to prevent the LLMs from simply copying solutions\nfrom their training data.\n(4)The prompts and corresponding outputs should be able to be\nevaluated automatically, since there will be many different tasks\nand LLM outputs.\n283\nHPDC ’24, June 3–7, 2024, Pisa, Italy Nichols et al.\nIn order to fulfill the requirements above, we propose ParEval,\na set of 420 prompts that cover twelve different computational\nproblem types and seven different execution models. Each problem\ntype has five different problems, and each problem has a prompt for\neach of the seven execution models, resulting in 420 total prompts.\nEach prompt in ParEval is a standalone function that requires the\nLLM to generate code that solves the problem either sequentially\nor in parallel.\nProblem Types. The problem types are listed and described in Ta-\nble 1. These were hand-selected by us, and represent a wide variety\nof common computational problems that are often parallelized.\nEach requires different strategies or APIs to solve in parallel. For\ninstance, the problems in the Sortproblem type require the LLM to\ngenerate code that sorts an array of values.\nTable 1: Descriptions of the twelve problem types in\nParEval. Each problem type has five concrete problems,\nand each problem has a prompt for all seven execution mod-\nels.\nProblem Type Description\nSortSort an array or sub-array of values;\nin-place and out-of-place.\nScanScan operations, such as prefix sum,\nover an array of values.\nDense Linear AlgebraDense linear algebra functions from\nall three levels of BLAS.\nSparse Linear AlgebraSparse linear algebra functions from\nall three levels of BLAS.\nSearchSearch for an element or property in\nan array of values.\nReduceReduction operation over an array\ndimension, such as computing a sum.\nHistogramBinning values based on a\nproperty of the data.\nStencilOne iteration of 1D and 2D stencil\nproblems, such as Jacobi relaxation.\nGraphGraph algorithms, such as\ncomponent counting.\nGeometryCompute geometric properties,\nsuch as convex hull.\nFourier TransformCompute standard and inverse\nFourier transforms.\nTransformMap a constant function to each\nelement of an array.\nProblems. The five problems within each problem type are de-\nsigned to test the core functionality of the problem type. To prevent\nprompting the model for a solution that is already in its training\ndataset, the five problems are small variations of the usual prob-\nlem type. For example, one of the scan problems is to compute the\nreverse prefix sum of an array, rather than directly computing the\nprefix sum. These variations still test the model’s understanding\nof the core computational problem, but mitigate the likelihood of\nit simply copying code from its training dataset. Listing 1 showsanother example of these problem variations. Another benefit of\nhaving five problems per problem type is that it provides more\ndata points for evaluating the LLM’s performance on that problem\ntype, but not so many that it becomes infeasible to implement and\nmaintain.\nPrompts. Each problem has a prompt for each of the seven exe-\ncution models that the LLM is required to generate code for. The\nseven execution models we test are: serial, OpenMP [ 37], MPI [ 42],\nMPI+OpenMP, Kokkos [ 45], CUDA [ 33], and HIP [ 2]. All the prompts\nare in C++, CUDA, or HIP. These represent both shared and dis-\ntributed memory programming models, as well as GPU program-\nming models. The prompts for each execution model are designed\nto be as similar to the other prompts for that problem as possi-\nble, while still being idiomatic for the programming model. For\nserial, OpenMP, MPI, and MPI+OpenMP prompts, we use STL data\nstructures such as std::vector andstd::array . For Kokkos, we\nutilize the Kokkos::View data structure (as shown in Listing 1).\nThe CUDA and HIP prompts use raw pointers to represent array\nstructures.\n#include <Kokkos_Core.hpp>\n/* Replace the i-th element of the array x with the minimum\nvalue from indices 0 through i.\nUse Kokkos to compute in parallel. Assume Kokkos has\nalready been initialized.\nExamples:\ninput: [8, 6, -1, 7, 3, 4, 4]\noutput: [8, 6, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1]\ninput: [5, 4, 6, 4, 3, 6, 1, 1]\noutput: [5, 4, 4, 4, 3, 3, 1, 1]\n*/\nvoid partialMinimums(Kokkos::View<float*> &x) {\nListing 1: An example Scanprompt for Kokkos. The LLM will\nbe tasked with completing the function body.\nWe list an example prompt in Listing 1 for a variant of a scan\nproblem to generate Kokkos code. The goal of this problem is to\ncompute the minimum value of the array up to each index. We\ninclude example inputs and outputs in the prompt as this can signif-\nicantly improve the quality of the generated code [ 7]. The necessary\n#include statements are also prepended to the prompt as we found\nthat this improves the likelihood of the LLM correctly using the\nrequired programming model.\n5 DESCRIPTION OF EVALUATION\nEXPERIMENTS\nNow that we have described the prompts in the previous section,\nwe describe how we can use them to evaluate the performance of\nLLMs on two different tasks – code generation and translation.\n5.1 Experiment 1: Parallel Code Generation\nThe first experiment studies the ability of LLMs to generate code,\neither sequential or in a specific parallel programming model, given\n284\nCan Large Language Models Write Parallel Code?

We evaluate LLMs\non how well they can generate code for all the prompts in ParEval.\nWe do so by asking the model to complete the function started in\nthe prompt, and then evaluating the generated code. By compiling\nand executing the generated code, we report different metrics that\nwill be described in Section 7. The metrics are computed over the\ncombined results from the OpenMP, MPI, MPI+OpenMP, Kokkos,\nCUDA, and HIP execution models, and compared with the same\nmetrics computed over the serial results. These results will provide\ninsight into how well the model can write parallel code based on\nnatural language descriptions. The results can also be compared\nalong the axes of execution model and problem type.\n5.2 Experiment 2: Parallel Code Translation\nThe second experiment studies the ability of LLMs to effectively\ntranslate code provided in one execution model to another execution\nmodel. To accomplish this, we prompt the LLM with a correct\nversion of the code in one execution model and ask it to translate\nit to another execution model. An example of this prompt format\nis shown in Listing 2. We evaluated several prompting formats for\ntranslation, such as giving examples of other successful translations,\nbut found the format in Listing 2 to be the most effective.\nIn theory, we could have evaluated translation capabilities be-\ntween each pair of execution models for each problem. However, to\nlimit the quadratic increase in the number of prompts, we only eval-\nuate translations for these pairs: serial→OpenMP ,serial→MPI,\nandCUDA→Kokkos . We identify these as some of the most rele-\nvant translation tasks for HPC developers. We compute the same\nmetrics as for Experiment 1. These results will provide insight into\nhow well the model can translate between different execution mod-\nels. The results can also be compared along the axes of source and\ntarget execution model and problem type.\n6 MODELS USED FOR COMPARISON\nWe choose to compare several state-of-the-art open-source and\nclosed-source LLMs, as well as smaller LLMs that are more practical\nfor use in production. We provide brief descriptions of the LLMs\nused in our evaluation, and their properties below. Table 2 provides\na summary and some salient properties of the models used.// A serial implementation of sumOfMinimumElements\n/* Return the sum of the minimum value at each index of vectors\nx and y for all indices.\ni.e. sum = min(x_0, y_0) + min(x_1, y_1) + min(x_2, y_2) + ...\nExample:\ninput: x=[3, 4, 0, 2, 3], y=[2, 5, 3, 1, 7]\noutput: 10\n*/\ndouble sumOfMinimumElements(std::vector<double> const& x,\nstd::vector<double> const& y) {\ndouble sum = 0.0;\nfor (size_t i= 0; i <x.size(); ++i) {\nsum +=std::min(x[i], y[i]);\n}\nreturn sum;\n}\n// An OpenMP implementation of sumOfMinimumElements\n/* Return the sum of the minimum value at each index of vectors\nx and y for all indices.\ni.e. sum = min(x_0, y_0) + min(x_1, y_1) + min(x_2, y_2) + ...\nUse OpenMP to sum in parallel.\nExample:\ninput: x=[3, 4, 0, 2, 3], y=[2, 5, 3, 1, 7]\noutput: 10\n*/\ndouble sumOfMinimumElements(std::vector<double> const& x,\nstd::vector<double> const& y) {\nListing 2: An example prompt given to the model for code\ntranslation. The model is given a sequential implementa-\ntion of sumOfMinimumElements and tasked with translat-\ning it to OpenMP.\nCodeLlama (CL-7B, CL-13B, and CL-34B). Rozière et al. origi-\nnally introduced CodeLlama models in [ 41] as variants of the Llama\n2 model [ 44], fine-tuned for code. All three models started with\nLlama 2 weights and were then fine-tuned on 500 billion tokens\nfrom a dataset of predominantly code. The Llama 2 models were\nalso extended to support longer context lengths of 16k and infill-\ning to generate code in the middle of sequences. We select these\nmodels as they are amongst the top performing open-source LLMs.\nAdditionally, the CodeLlama models are very accessible as there\nare small model sizes available and there exists a thriving software\necosystem surrounding Llama 2 based models.\n285\nHPDC ’24, June 3–7, 2024, Pisa, Italy Nichols et al.\nStarCoderBase. The StarCoderBase model [ 29] is a 15.5B param-\neter model trained on 1 trillion tokens from The Stack [ 27]. In\naddition to code from 80+ programming languages, its data set\nincludes natural language in git commits and Jupyter notebooks.\nStarCoderBase supports infilling as well as a multitude of custom\ntokens specific to code text data. The model architecture is based\non the SantaCoder model [ 6], and it supports a context length of\n8K tokens. We select StarCoderBase as it is one of the best perform-\ning open-source models around its size, and is frequently used for\ncomparisons in related literature.\nPhind-CodeLlama-V2. The Phind-CodeLlama-V2 model [ 39] is\na CodeLlama-34B model fine-tuned on over 1.5 billion tokens of\ncode data. At the time we were selecting models for comparison it\ntopped the BigCode Models Leaderboard [ 1] among open-access\nmodels on HumanEval with a pass@1 score of 71.95. However, the\nfine-tuning dataset for this model is not publicly available, so it is\nnot possible to ensure that the BigCode benchmarks themselves\nare not included in Phind’s fine-tuning dataset.\nGPT-3.5 and GPT-4. GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 are closed-source LLMs\nfrom OpenAI [ 8,34]. Most information about these models is not\npublicly available, however, they can be used for inference via a paid\nAPI. We use the most up-to-date versions of these models available\nat the time of writing, the gpt-3.5-turbo-1106 andgpt-4-1106-preview\nmodels. Unlike the other models tested, these are instruction-tuned\nand aligned to human preferences. Rather than using them for\ndirect code generation, we have to interact with them via a chat\ninterface. As with the Phind-CodeLlama-V2 model, the data used to\ntrain these models is not publicly available, so it is difficult to fairly\ncompare them with the other models as they might have seen some\nprompts during training.\n7 EVALUATION METRICS\nIt is important to be able to meaningfully compare the performance\nof the selected LLMs at generating correct and efficient code for\nthe prompts in ParEval. This section details how we accomplish\nthis by adopting a popular correctness metric for code LLMs, and\ndefining two new performance-related metrics.\n7.1 Metric for Correctness\nWe adopt the pass@ 𝑘metric from [ 13] to quantify correctness\nof the generated code. For a given prompt, pass@ 𝑘estimates the\nprobability that the model will generate a correct solution given 𝑘\nattempts. Often the average pass@ 𝑘over all prompts in a bench-\nmark is reported. To estimate the pass@ 𝑘over a set of prompts, we\nfirst generate 𝑁samples for each prompt using the model, where\n𝑁>𝑘. These samples are then evaluated for correctness. The num-\nber of correct samples can be used to estimate the pass@ 𝑘value as\nshown in Equation (1).\npass@ 𝑘=1\n|𝑃|Õ\n𝑝∈𝑃\"\n1−\u0012𝑁−𝑐𝑝\n𝑘\u0013\n/\u0012𝑁\n𝑘\u0013#\n(1)Number of samples generated per prompt\nSet\nof promptsNumb\ner of correct\nsamples for prompt 𝑝This metric provides insight into how often do models generate\ncorrect code. The probability that the model will generate a correct\nsolution in one attempt, pass@1, is the most useful metric for end-\nusers as it aligns with how LLMs are used in practice. In this paper,\nwe report 100×pass@𝑘as is common in related literature and online\nleaderboards [ 1,12]. Additionally, as models have become more\ncapable, studies have shifted toward only reporting pass@1 values.\nHowever, pass@ 𝑘values for 𝑘>1are still useful for understanding\nhow models perform on more difficult prompts. Commonly reported\nvalues of 𝑘are 1, 5, 10, 20, and 100. It is also common to report\npass@1 values using a generation temperature of 0.2 and pass@ 𝑘\nfor higher values of 𝑘using a generation temperature of 0.8. This\nhigher temperature allows the model to more extensively explore\nthe solution space when generating a larger number of attempts.\n7.2 Performance Metrics\nFor parallel and HPC code, it is important to consider both the\ncorrectness and performance of the generated code. To analyze\nand compare the runtime performance of LLM generated code, we\nintroduce two new metrics: speedup𝑛@𝑘andefficiency𝑛@𝑘.\nspeedup n@k.The first metric, speedup𝑛@𝑘, measures the expected\nbest performance speedup of the generated code relative to the per-\nformance of a sequential baseline (see Section 8.2) if the model\nis given 𝑘attempts to generate the code. The relative speedup is\ncomputed based on the execution time obtained using 𝑛processes\nor threads. For a given prompt 𝑝, the expected best speedup relative\nto a sequential baseline, 𝑇∗𝑝, is given by Equation (2).\nE\"\nmax(\n𝑇∗𝑝\n𝑇𝑝\n,𝑠1,𝑛, . . . ,𝑇∗𝑝\n𝑇𝑝\n,𝑠𝑘,𝑛)#\n=𝑁Õ\n𝑗=1𝑗−1\n𝑘−1\u0001\n𝑁\n𝑘\u0001𝑇∗𝑝\n𝑇𝑝,𝑗,𝑛(2)\nruntime\nof sample 𝑗of prompt 𝑝on𝑛resourcesruntime\nof sequential baseline for prompt 𝑝\nTo demonstrate that Equation (2) represents the desired quantity,\nconsider the set of 𝑁generated samples is in order from slowest\nto fastest. This is without loss of generality as we assume the 𝑘\nsamples are selected uniformly and, thus, all size 𝑘permutations\nare equally likely. The probability that the max is the 𝑗th sample\nis given by𝑗−1\n𝑘−1\u0001/𝑁\n𝑘\u0001, as there must be 𝑗−1elements before 𝑗\nand, thus,𝑗−1\n𝑘−1\u0001ways to select the remaining elements. The sum\nof these probabilities, each weighted by their respective speedups,\ngives the expected max speedup over 𝑘samples. Taking the average\nof Equation (2) over all prompts we can define the speedup𝑛@𝑘\nmetric as shown in Equation (3).\nspeedup𝑛@𝑘=1\n|𝑃|Õ\n𝑝∈𝑃𝑁Õ\n𝑗=1𝑗−1\n𝑘−1\u0001\n𝑁\n𝑘\u0001𝑇∗𝑝\n𝑇𝑝,𝑗,𝑛(3)\nFor a single LLM, the speedup𝑛@𝑘metric can be used to under-\nstand how well its generated code performs compared to sequential\nbaselines. A value greater than 1 indicates that the generated code\nis faster than the baseline on average, while a value less than 1 indi-\ncates that the generated code is generally slower than the baseline.\nWhen comparing multiple LLMs, a higher value of speedup𝑛@𝑘\nsignifies more performant code. It is important to note that this\n286\nCan Large Language Models Write Parallel Code? HPDC ’24, June 3–7, 2024, Pisa, Italy\nmetric is hardware dependent and, thus, to compare models fairly\nall the run times need to be collected on the same hardware.\nThe speedup𝑛@𝑘metric also gives insight into how well the\ngenerated code makes use of parallelism in its computation. It is\nfixed to a given number of resources, 𝑛, which can either be threads\nor processes, depending on the model of parallelism being used.\nIt also adds another axis to vary when comparing models. When\nstudying a single model, the speedup𝑛@𝑘metric can be compared\nat different values of 𝑛to understand the complete scaling behavior\nof that model. When comparing multiple models, it is typically\nmost useful to fix 𝑛to a single value. One could also average over\nmany values of 𝑛, but this risks hiding too much information to be\nuseful.\nspeedup max@k.We also define a variant of the speedup𝑛@𝑘met-\nric,speedupmax@𝑘, as shown in Equation (4), which estimates the\nmaximum speedup over all 𝑛and not a fixed resource count.\nspeedupmax@𝑘=1\n|𝑃|Õ\n𝑝∈𝑃𝑁·|procs|Õ\n𝑗=1\n𝑛∈procs𝑗−1\n𝑘−1\u0001\n𝑁·|procs|\n𝑘\u0001𝑇∗𝑝\n𝑇𝑝,𝑗,𝑛(4)\nHere procs is the set of resource counts over which the experiments\ncan be performed. For example, if there are 128 hardware cores,\nprocs =1,2,4,8,16,32,64,128processes or threads.\nefficiency n@k.To further understand the parallel performance of\nthe generated code, we define the efficiency𝑛@𝑘metric. This metric\nmeasures the expected best performance efficiency (speedup per\nprocess or thread) if the model is given 𝑘attempts to generate the\ncode. This is easily defined by modifying Equation (3) to divide by\n𝑛as shown in Equation (5). The possible values of this metric range\nbetween 0 and 1.0, with 1.0 representing a model that generates\ncode that scales perfectly with the number of processes or threads.\nThis metric is useful for understanding how well the generated\ncode makes use of parallel resources. In addition to efficiency𝑛@𝑘,\nwe also define efficiencymax@𝑘in the same fashion as Equation (4).\nefficiency𝑛@𝑘=1\n|𝑃|Õ\n𝑝∈𝑃𝑁Õ\n𝑗=1𝑗−1\n𝑘−1\u0001\n𝑁\n𝑘\u0001𝑇∗𝑝\n𝑛·𝑇𝑝,𝑗,𝑛(5)\nEven though we explore parallel code generation in this paper,\nthese metrics can be used to consider the performance of sequen-\ntial code generation as well. For example, examining speedup1@𝑘\nfor the HumanEval, MBPP, or DS-1000 benchmarks will lead to a\nbetter understanding of how efficient the generated Python code is\ncompared to a human created baseline. Additionally, both perfor-\nmance metrics could be modified to be parameterized by problem\nsize instead of number of processes/threads in order to study the\ncomputational complexity of the generated code.\n8 EXPERIMENTAL SETUP\nThis section describes how we generate outputs using each of the\nLLMs (Section 6) and the prompts in ParEval, and how we evalu-\nated the generated code using the ParEval test harness.\n8.1 LLM Inference: Generating Code Output\nTo generate outputs with the open-source models, we use the Hug-\ngingFace library [ 48] with PyTorch [ 38] as the backend to load theLLM weights and use them for inference. Specifically, we create a\nPyTorch Dataset object that wraps the set of prompts and we pass\nthis as input to a Huggingface Pipeline object, which then runs the\nmodels in inference mode and generates the outputs. We do these\nruns on a single NVIDIA A100 80GB GPU using 16-bit floating\npoint precision. Since the prompt workloads are fairly regular, we\nget the best inference performance for larger batch sizes. So for\neach model, we use the largest batch size that fits in GPU memory.\nTo generate the GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 outputs we use the OpenAI\nAPI [35] via OpenAI’s Python client [36].\nFor all of the tasks, we use nucleus sampling with a value of\n𝑝=0.95. Additionally, we limit the maximum number of new\ntokens generated to 1024. We experimentally found this to be long\nenough for all of the tasks to be completed, but short enough to limit\nlong, repetitive outputs. Using this configuration, we create two\nsets of outputs for each model: one with 20 samples per prompt and\na temperature of 0.2, and the other with 200 samples per prompt and\na temperature of 0.8. The former is used to calculate the metrics at\n𝑘=1(such as pass@1) and the latter for larger values of 𝑘. This is in\nline with the generation configurations in related literature [ 29,41].\nNote that we exclude the evaluation of GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 with\n200 samples per prompt and a temperature of 0.8 due to the high\nmonetary cost of generating these outputs.\n8.2 Evaluating the Generated Code\nTo evaluate the generated code, we use the ParEval test harness.\nThe test harness is a set of scripts that compile and run the gen-\nerated code using manually written test drivers for each problem.\nThe scripts handle recording the compile status, correctness, and\nexecution time of the generated code.\nTo compile the generated code, we use the GNU Compiler Collec-\ntion (GCC) version 9.4.0. For serial, OpenMP, and Kokkos versions,\nwe use GCC as the primary compiler, whereas we use it as the\nbackend to the respective frontend compiler for the other models\n(i.e. the backend compiler to mpicxx). All compilations use the flags\n-O3 -std=c++17 and the OpenMP tasks add the -fopenmp flag. We\nuse version 4.1.0 of Kokkos, and the threads execution space, which\nuses C++ threads for parallelism. MPI codes are compiled with\nOpenMPI version 4.1.1. CUDA programs are compiled with nvcc\nand CUDA version 12.1.1. Likewise, HIP programs are compiled\nwith hipcc and ROCm version 5.7.0.\nBefore compiling an output, the prompt and generated code are\nwritten to a header file that is included by the driver script for\nthat task. Once compiled, the generated binary is run by the test\nharness. The test harness checks if the generated code produces the\nsame results as the sequential baseline. The sequential baselines\nare handwritten, optimal implementations of the prompt that are\nused to test correctness and to calculate the performance metrics\n(see Section 7.2). Additionally, a code can be labeled as incorrect\nfor the following reasons:\n•The code does not compile or it takes longer than three minutes\nto run. We choose the problem sizes for each prompt such that\nany reasonable implementations execute in much less than three\nminutes.\n287\nHPDC ’24, June 3–7, 2024, Pisa, Italy Nichols et al.\n•The code does not use its respective parallel programming model.\nFor example, if the model generates a sequential implementa-\ntion rather than using OpenMP when prompted to do so, it is\nlabeled as incorrect. We utilize several string matching criteria\nto implement this check.\nThe output of the program includes the result of the correctness\ncheck of the generated code, the average runtime of the generated\ncode, and that of the sequential baseline over ten runs. We use the\ndefault timer for each execution model to measure its run time.\nThe CPU runs are conducted on an AMD EPYC 7763, 2.45 GHz\nCPU with 64 physical cores and 512 GB of RAM. We run with\n1,2,4, . . . , 32threads for OpenMP and Kokkos. For MPI, we run with\n1,2,4, . . . , 512processes across multiple nodes with one process per\nphysical core. For MPI+OpenMP we run on 1, 2, 3, and 4 nodes with\n1 process per node and 1,2,4, . . . , 64threads per node. The CUDA\nruns are completed on an NVIDIA A100 80GB GPU and the AMD\nruns on an AMD MI50 GPU. Kernels are launched with the number\nof threads indicated in the prompt text (i.e. at least as many threads\nas values in the array).\n9 EVALUATION RESULTS\nWe now present detailed results from evaluating the LLMs described\nin Section 6 using the ParEval prompts and test harness.\n9.1 Experiment 1: Parallel Code Generation\nRQ1 How well do state-of-the-art LLMs generate parallel\ncode, and which models are the best?\nTo evaluate the correctness of the code generated by the LLMs\nwe first look at the pass@1 scores over ParEval. Figure 1 shows the\npass@1 score for each LLM for generating the serial code versus\nthe average over the six parallel execution models. As defined\nin Equation (1), these values are aggregated over all the prompts\nincluding problem types and execution models. Notably, all of the\nLLMs score significantly worse for parallel code generation than\nthey do for serial code generation. The best performing models,\nGPT-3.5 and GPT-4, both achieve ∼76 pass@1 on the serial prompts.\nThis is a strong score in the context of other benchmarks, such as\nHumanEval, where GPT-4 gets 84.1 (see Table 2). Despite the strong\nserial scores, GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 only achieve 39.6 and 37.8 pass@1,\nrespectively, on the parallel prompts.\nThe open-source models show a significant decrease in perfor-\nmance for parallel code generation with all of them except Phind-V2\n(Phind-CodeLlama-V2) scoring between 10.2 and 18.6. Phind-V2\ndoes much better than the other open-source models, achieving\n32 pass@1 on the parallel prompts. This suggests that further fine-\ntuning of the open-source code models can improve their perfor-\nmance on parallel code generation. Additionally, it is significant that\nan open-source model performs near to the closed-source models\non parallel code generation. Open-source models are more accessi-\nble and, thus, having a strong open-source model for parallel code\ngeneration would be beneficial to the community.\nAnother interesting trend we observe in Figure 1 is that CodeLlama-\n34B and GPT-4 both score worse than their smaller counterparts\nCL-7B CL-13B StarCoderBase CL-34B Phind-V2 GPT -3.5 GPT -4020406080100pass@148.452.8 51.7 54.065.676.0 76.1\n15.3 17.4 18.6\n10.232.139.6 37.8Serial vs Parallel pass@1\nserial parallelFigure 1: Each LLM’s pass@1 score over ParEval. All of the\nLLMs score significantly worse in generating parallel code\nthan serial code.\non parallel code generation. The reasons for this decrease in per-\nformance are not immediately obvious. However, we observe that\nCodeLlama-34B and GPT-4 often generate the same output for a\ngiven prompt for most or all of the 20 samples. This is due to the\nlarger models being more “confident” in their outputs, but this can\nhave an adverse effect on the pass@1 score when the output is\nincorrect.\nUltimately, the closed-source models are better than the open-\nsource models at parallel code generation. Interestingly, GPT-3.5\nbeats GPT-4 on the parallel prompts by almost 2 percentage points,\nsuggesting it may be better suited for parallel code generation tasks.\nThis is interesting since GPT-4 is bigger and newer than GPT-3.5 and\ngenerally obtains better results on other code and natural language\nbenchmarks. Amongst the open-source models, Phind-V2 has the\nbest results, but still lags behind the closed-source models by almost\n8 percentage points.\nIn addition to pass@1 it is also useful to consider pass@ 𝑘for\n𝑘>1to understand how the LLMs perform provided more attempts\nat a problem. Figure 2 shows the pass@ 𝑘for each LLM for 𝑘=\n1,5,10,20with 200 samples and a temperature of 0.8 for 𝑘≠1.\nThe GPT models are omitted for 𝑘>1due to the monetary cost\nof generating a large number of samples with these models. We\nobserve the same relative ordering as in Figure 1 is maintained for\nall values of 𝑘with Phind-V2 leading the open-source LLMs. At\n𝑘=20Phind-V2 achieves a pass@ 𝑘of 46 meaning that on average\nit is able to generate a correct answer to one of the parallel prompts\nin 20 attempts 46% of the time. The scores of each LLM improving\nwith an increase in 𝑘is expected due to the nature of the pass@ 𝑘\nmetric. The fact that each LLM begins to plateau suggests that there\nis an upper limit to their ability to generate correct parallel code\nand giving them more attempts does not significantly improve their\nperformance.\nRQ2 Which parallel execution models and problem types\nare most challenging for LLMs?\n9.1.1 Breakdowns by Execution Models. We further break down\nthe pass@1 results by each execution model in Figure 3. From this\ndata we observe that every LLM follows a similar distribution of\n288\nCan Large Language Models Write Parallel Code?

The LLMs gen-\nerally follow the same distribution of scores across the\nexecution models: serial (best), OpenMP, CUDA/HIP, and\nMPI/MPI+OpenMP (worst) with Kokkos varying between\nLLMs.\nThe pass@1 of LLMs being better with OpenMP than other\nparallel execution models is likely due to the fact that OpenMP\ncode is the most similar to serial code. For many problems it only\nrequires adding an OpenMP pragma, and occasionally a reduction\nclause. GPT-4 gets nearly as many OpenMP problems correct as\nserial problems, with an OpenMP pass@1 of 60 vs a 76 serial pass@1.\nThe other top LLMs, GPT-3.5 and Phind-V2, are also nearly as\nefficient on OpenMP problems as serial problems. StarCoderBase\nand the CodeLlama models have a larger gap between their serial\nand OpenMP pass@1 scores, but still have better results on OpenMP\nthan the other parallel execution models.\nWith the larger LLMs, Kokkos is consistently just behind OpenMP\nin its pass@1 results. Like OpenMP, Kokkos is a shared memory\nparallel programming model that relies mostly on high-level ab-\nstract constructs to parallelize code. These high-level abstractionsmake it simpler for the LLM to translate the prompt text to code.\nThe smaller LLMs struggle with Kokkos, likely due to the fact that\nKokkos is more verbose than OpenMP and is more niche than\nthe other parallel execution models leading to less inclusion in\ntheir training data. With fewer Kokkos examples in the dataset the\nsmaller LLMs likely struggle to learn how to model Kokkos code\nwell.\nFollowing Kokkos, we observe that all the LLMs are next most\nefficient for CUDA/HIP. These two always have a similar pass@1\nscore, which is likely due to the similarity of CUDA and HIP. All of\nthe open-source LLMs have a slightly better pass@1 with HIP than\nCUDA, while the closed-source LLMs are slightly better with CUDA\nthan HIP. CUDA/HIP kernels are more complex than OpenMP and\nKokkos, but the parallelism is intrinsic to the kernel making it\neasier than MPI, since the LLM does not need to reason about large\nchanges to the underlying algorithm.\nMPI and MPI+OpenMP are generally the worst parallel execu-\ntion models for all the LLMs (except for CodeLlama 7B and 13B\nwhere they are second and third worst). Compared to the other\nexecution models in our testing, MPI implementations often differ\nthe most from their sequential counterparts. This complexity makes\nit difficult for the LLMs to generate correct MPI code. Based on the\nresults for all the execution models, we hypothesize that this trend\ngeneralizes to all parallel execution models: the more different a\nparallel programming model’s code is from the corresponding serial\ncode, the more difficult it is for the LLMs to generate correct code\nin that programming model.\n9.1.2 Breakdowns by Problem Types. In addition to execution\nmodels it is also important to understand what types of computa-\ntional problems LLMs struggle to parallelize. Figure 4 shows the\npass@1 score for each problem type across all the LLMs. As a\ngeneral trend, we observe that all LLMs are better at generating\nparallel solutions for structured, dense problems and worse for\nunstructured, sparse problems.\nAll of the LLMs get their best pass@1 scores for transform prob-\nlems with the exception of GPT-3.5 where it is the second best.\nTransform problems are the simplest as they are completely data\nparallel. In addition to transform, all of the LLMs generally score\nwell on reduction and search. These are also fairly simple to paral-\nlelize as searching requires little to no communication and reduc-\ntions are often offered as high-level constructs in parallel program-\nming models.\nPhind-V2 and the GPT LLMs score well on stencil, histogram, and\ndense linear algebra problems. These problems are all structured\nand dense, which makes them easier for the LLMs to parallelize.\nThese three problems are in the middle of the group for StarCoder-\nBase and the CodeLlama LLMs coming after transform, search, and\nreduce. This suggests that the larger LLMs are better at paralleliz-\ning these types of problems. Interestingly, StarCoderBase and the\nCodeLlama LLMs all have graph problems in their top four to five\nproblem types, which is not the case for Phind-V2 and the GPTs.\nThe bottom five problem types for all of the LLMs are sparse\nlinear algebra, scan, fft, geometry, and sort. GPT-4 is the exception\nwith graph instead of sort as the fifth-worst problem type. Sparse\nlinear algebra is generally the worst problem type, which is likely\ndue to the difficulty in parallelizing sparse computations.

The LLMs are best at transform problems, while they are worst at sparse linear algebra\nproblems.\ngeometry problems are also generally more difficult to parallelize\nso it readily follows that the LLMs would struggle with them. The\nsorting and scan results are more surprising. Parallel implementa-\ntions for sort and scan are well known and certain execution models\nlike OpenMP and MPI even offer high-level abstractions for scan.\nFigure 5 provides an even more detailed view of the pass@1\nmetric across both execution models and problem types for GPT-4.\nWe see the same trends as in Figures 3 and 4 for GPT-4, however,\nwe can also see where certain trends do not hold. For example,\ndespite being the best LLM for search problems and the best LLM\nat Kokkos, GPT-4 does not do well on Kokkos search problems. We\nalso see that MPI and MPI+OpenMP scores on a particular problem\ntype are not always the same. This suggests that the model has\ndifficulty dealing with these dual execution models.\nsparse_la fftgeometry scan sort stencil hist. dense_la graph reduce search transform\nProblem Typeserial\nomp\nkokkos\ncuda\nhip\nmpi\nmpi+ompExecution Model35.0 55.0 60.0 40.0 100.0 80.0 100.0 85.0 58.0 100.0 100.0 100.0\n40.0 35.0 0.0 2.0 79.0 80.0 89.0 80.0 45.0 100.0 89.0 80.0\n39.0 3.0 35.0 35.0 64.0 80.0 58.0 73.0 46.0 61.0 27.0 100.0\n0.0 40.0 0.0 39.0 20.0 60.0 64.0 60.0 15.0 2.0 41.0 100.0\n0.0 0.0 0.0 21.0 20.0 60.0 44.0 60.0 7.0 21.0 60.0 100.0\n7.0 13.0 51.0 9.0 24.0 23.0 6.0 27.0 15.0 19.0 76.0 5.0\n9.0 20.0 21.0 0.0 23.0 44.0 12.0 11.0 44.0 42.0 21.0 22.0pass@1 for GPT -4\n020406080100\nFigure 5: pass@1 for GPT-4 across all execution models and\nproblem types.

When writing parallel code, it\nis important to consider performance in addition to correctness.\nA parallel implementation that is correct, but makes inefficient\nuse of resources is not useful in practice. Hence, we compare the\nspeedup 𝑛@k and efficiency 𝑛@k metrics for each LLM.\nCL-7B CL-13B StarCoderBase CL-34B Phind-V2 GPT -3.5 GPT -40510152025speedup@16.9810.288.73\n6.9112.9016.5220.28\n0.070.09 0.090.060.09 0.110.13speedup n@1 and efficiency n@1 for Parallel Problems\nspeedup@1 efficiency@1\n0.00.20.40.60.81.0\nefficiency@1\nFigure 6: speedup𝑛@1and efficiency𝑛@1for parallel prompts.\nResults are shown for 𝑛=32threads for OpenMP and Kokkos,\n𝑛=512ranks for MPI, and 𝑛=(4ranks)×( 64threads) for\nMPI+OpenMP.

For CUDA/HIP, 𝑛is set to the num-\nber of kernel threads, which varies across prompts.1\n1Search problems are omitted from speedup 𝑛@k and efficiency 𝑛@k results due to\ntheir high super-linear speedups preventing a meaningful analysis of the performance\nresults for other problem types.\n290\nCan Large Language Models Write Parallel Code?

Phind-V2\nis most efficient for MPI prompts, but is one of the least efficient for OpenMP and Kokkos. GPT-4 is the most efficient for\nOpenMP and Kokkos prompts.1\nIn Figure 6, we see a trend similar to the pass@1 scores in Fig-\nure 1, with the GPT models scoring the highest and the CodeLlama\nmodels scoring the lowest. Despite GPT-3.5 having the highest\npass@1 for parallel prompts, GPT-4 has the highest speedup 𝑛@1\nfor all parallel execution models at 20.28. This means that on av-\nerage GPT-4’s parallel code achieves a 20.28x speedup over the\nsequential baseline. To help interpret this result, we also show the\nefficiency 𝑛@1 for each LLM for the parallel prompts in Figure 6.\nFrom this we see that none of the LLMs use parallel resources ef-\nficiently. The best efficiency 𝑛@1 is 0.13 for GPT-4 meaning that\non average GPT-4’s parallel code achieves 13% of the maximum\npossible speedup. CodeLlama-34B has the worst efficiency 𝑛@1 at\n0.06. From the results in Figure 6 we can conclude that the parallel\ncode produced by LLMs is generally inefficient even when correct.\nIt is also important to consider how efficiency 𝑛@1 varies across\n𝑛. Figure 7 compares the efficiency 𝑛@1 curves for MPI, OpenMP,\nand Kokkos. We see Phind-V2 is the most efficient at MPI prompts,\nwhile the least efficient at OpenMP and second to least for Kokkos.\nGPT-4 produces the most efficient code on average as it is one of\nthe top two most efficient for all three execution models. All of the\nmodels start with better efficiency 𝑛@1 for OpenMP than Kokkos,\nbut rapidly decline towards an efficiency 𝑛@1 of∼0.2. On the other\nhand, the Kokkos efficiency 𝑛@1 values stay roughly consistent\nacross 𝑛, showing efficient use of threads.\nFigure 8 further shows the expected maximum speedup and\nefficiency across all resource counts 𝑛. We see the same trends as\nin Figure 6 with the speedups at similar values and the efficiencies\nhigher. This is likely due to a number of the generated code samples\nplateauing at a certain 𝑛, so choosing a smaller 𝑛can give a better\nefficiency with the same speedup.\n9.2 Experiment 2: Parallel Code Translation\nRQ4 How well can LLMs translate between execution mod-\nels? How performant and scalable is the translated code?\nIn addition to generating parallel code from scratch, we also\nevaluate the LLMs ability to translate between execution models\n(see Section 5.2). Figure 9 shows the pass@1 scores for each LLM for\ntranslating serial to OpenMP, serial to MPI, and CUDA to Kokkos.\nCL-7B CL-13B StarCoderBase CL-34B Phind-V2 GPT -3.5 GPT -40510152025speedup max@1\n5.7711.05\n7.64 7.5313.0616.7920.11\n0.40 0.420.370.330.45 0.450.48speedup max@1 and efficiency max@1 for Parallel Problems\nspeedup max@1 efficiency max@1\n0.00.20.40.60.81.0\nefficiency max@1Figure 8: The expected max speedup and efficiency across all\nresource counts 𝑛.\nWe also include the generation pass@1 scores from Figure 3 for\neach LLM for OpenMP, MPI, and Kokkos.\nCL-7B CL-13B StarCoderBase CL-34B Phind-V2 GPT -3.5 GPT -4020406080100pass@1pass@1 for Translation\nomp\nserial ⇒ ompmpi\nserial ⇒ mpikokkos\ncuda ⇒ kokkos\nFigure 9: pass@1 for each LLM when translating serial to\nOpenMP, serial to MPI, and CUDA to Kokkos compared to\nthe pass@1 score for generating code in the destination ex-\necution model. The smaller LLMs see a significant improve-\nment when shown an example correct implementation.\nSeveral LLMs score significantly better when given a correct\nexample implementation in a different execution model i.e. trans-\nlation. All LLMs, except for GPT-3.5, have a higher pass@1 score\nfor translating to OpenMP than they do for generating OpenMP\ncode from scratch. We observe that the LLMs are able to correctly\n291\nHPDC ’24, June 3–7, 2024, Pisa, Italy Nichols et al.\nparallelize the provided serial code with OpenMP. A similar trend\nemerges with the serial to MPI translation. All of the LLMs score\nbetter when translating serial code to MPI than they do when gen-\nerating MPI code from scratch. Likewise, all of the LLMs see an\nimprovement translating from CUDA to Kokkos over native Kokkos\ngeneration with the exception of the GPT models.\nIt is expected that the pass@1 scores would either increase or\nstay the same, since the LLM is given more information during\ntranslation than when generating code from scratch. It is surprising,\nhowever, the magnitude of improvement that the smaller LLMs\nexperience. For example, CodeLlama-7B has a pass@1 of 20 for\ngenerating OpenMP code from scratch, but a pass@1 of 52 for\ntranslating serial code to OpenMP. This suggests that providing\nLLMs with correct implementations can improve their ability to\ngenerate correct parallel code.\n9.2.1 Speedup and Efficiency. While translating between exe-\ncution models improves the pass@1 score it does not generally\nimprove the performance of the generated code as shown in Fig-\nure 10. Most LLMs see a similar efficiency 𝑛@1 for OpenMP, MPI,\nand Kokkos whether generating from scratch or translating be-\ntween execution models. A number of LLMs actually perform worse\nwhen translating from serial to OpenMP.\nCL-7B CL-13B StarCoderBase CL-34B Phind-V2 GPT -3.5 GPT -40.00.20.40.60.81.0efficiency@1efficiency n@1 for Translating Parallel Problems\nomp\nserial ⇒ ompmpi\nserial ⇒ mpikokkos\ncuda ⇒ kokkos\nFigure 10: efficiency@1 translation scores compared to gen-\neration scores. The LLMs generally score similarly for trans-\nlation and generation.1\nWe observe similar trends with OpenMP and Kokkos for speedup 𝑛@1\nas shown in Figure 11. The LLMs generally perform similarly for\ntranslation and generation. The exception is MPI where CodeLlama-\n13B, CodeLlama-34B, and GPT-4 all get significantly better speedup 𝑛@1\nwhen translating from serial to MPI code. From the results in Fig-\nures 9 to 11 we conclude that providing LLMs with correct imple-\nmentations in one execution model helps them generate correct\ncode in another execution model, but does not necessarily improve\nthe performance of the generated code.\n10 CONCLUSION\nIn this paper, we proposed a Parallel Code Generation Evaluation\n(ParEval) benchmark for evaluating the ability of LLMs to generate\nparallel code. We additionally introduced two novel metrics for\nevaluating the runtime performance and scaling behavior of the\ngenerated parallel code. Using ParEval and these metrics, we have\nevaluated the ability of state-of-the-art open- and closed-source\nCL-7B CL-13B StarCoderBase CL-34B Phind-V2 GPT -3.5 GPT -40510152025speedup@1speedup n@1 for Translating Parallel Problems\nomp\nserial ⇒ ompmpi\nserial ⇒ mpikokkos\ncuda ⇒ kokkosFigure 11: speedup@1 translation scores compared to gen-\neration scores. The LLMs generally perform similarly for\ntranslation and generation with the exception of MPI.1\nLLMs to generate parallel code. We find that LLMs are significantly\nworse at generating parallel code than they are at generating serial\ncode. In particular, we find that LLMs struggle most with MPI\ncode and sparse, unstructured problems. Further, we observe that\nclosed-source models outperform all the open-source models we\ntested, and that even when LLMs generate correct parallel code, it is\noften not performant or scalable. Providing correct implementations\nin one execution model (i.e. serial) helps LLMs generate correct\nparallel code, but does not necessarily improve the performance or\nscalability of the generated parallel code.\nThe poor performance of LLMs on ParEval indicates that further\nefforts are necessary to improve the ability of LLMs to model parallel\ncode and/or create new LLMs that are specialized for parallel code\ngeneration. These LLMs will need to improve both the correctness\nand runtime performance of their outputs. Benchmarks, such as\nParEval, are vital to creating and improving LLMs for parallel\ncode generation. By iterating on ParEval and the metrics we have\nproposed, we can continue to improve the ability of LLMs in this\ndomain and create state-of-the-art open-source LLMs for different\nparallel code development tasks.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis material is based upon work supported in part by the National\nScience Foundation under Grant No. 2047120, and by the National\nScience Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship Program un-\nder Grant No. DGE 2236417.

However, their ability to access and precisely manipulate\nknowledge is still limited, and hence on knowledge-intensive tasks, their perfor-\nmance lags behind task-speciﬁc architectures. Additionally, providing provenance\nfor their decisions and updating their world knowledge remain open research prob-\nlems. Pre-trained models with a differentiable access mechanism to explicit non-\nparametric memory can overcome this issue, but have so far been only investigated\nfor extractive downstream tasks. We explore a general-purpose ﬁne-tuning recipe\nfor retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) — models which combine pre-trained\nparametric and non-parametric memory for language generation. We introduce\nRAG models where the parametric memory is a pre-trained seq2seq model and\nthe non-parametric memory is a dense vector index of Wikipedia, accessed with\na pre-trained neural retriever. We compare two RAG formulations, one which\nconditions on the same retrieved passages across the whole generated sequence,\nand another which can use different passages per token. We ﬁne-tune and evaluate\nour models on a wide range of knowledge-intensive NLP tasks and set the state of\nthe art on three open domain QA tasks, outperforming parametric seq2seq models\nand task-speciﬁc retrieve-and-extract architectures. For language generation tasks,\nwe ﬁnd that RAG models generate more speciﬁc, diverse and factual language than\na state-of-the-art parametric-only seq2seq baseline.\n1 Introduction\nPre-trained neural language models have been shown to learn a substantial amount of in-depth knowl-\nedge from data [ 47]. They can do so without any access to an external memory, as a parameterized\nimplicit knowledge base [ 51,52]. While this development is exciting, such models do have down-\nsides: They cannot easily expand or revise their memory, can’t straightforwardly provide insight into\ntheir predictions, and may produce “hallucinations” [ 38]. Hybrid models that combine parametric\nmemory with non-parametric (i.e., retrieval-based) memories [ 20,26,48] can address some of these\nissues because knowledge can be directly revised and expanded, and accessed knowledge can be\ninspected and interpreted. REALM [ 20] and ORQA [ 31], two recently introduced models that\ncombine masked language models [ 8] with a differentiable retriever, have shown promising results,\n34th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2020), Vancouver, Canada.\nThe\u0003DiYineComed\\\u0003(x)TQXeU\\EQcRdeUT([)MIPSpθGeneUaWoU¬Sѡ(PaUaPeWULc)MaUgin-ali]eThiV\u000314Wh\u0003cenWXU\\\u0003ZoUkiV\u0003diYided\u0003inWo\u00033VecWionV:\u0003\"InfeUno\",\"PXUgaWoUio\"\u0003&\"PaUadiVo\"\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003(y)End-to-End Backprop through T and¬pθBaUack\u0003Obama\u0003ZaVboUn\u0003in\u0003HaZaii.(x)FacW VeUiÀcaWiRQ: FacW QXeU\\VXppoUWV\u0003(y)\nQXeVWiRQ GeQeUaWiRQFacW VeUiÀcaWiRQ:LabeO GeQeUaWiRQDRcXmeQWIQde[Define\u0003\"middle\u0003eaU\"(x)QXeVWiRQ AQVZeUiQg:QXeVWiRQ QXeU\\The\u0003middle\u0003eaU\u0003inclXdeVWhe\u0003W\\mpanic\u0003caYiW\\\u0003andWhe\u0003WhUee\u0003oVVicleV.\u0003\u0003(y)QXeVWiRQ AQVZeUiQg:AQVZeU GeQeUaWiRQReWUieYeU Sη(NRQ-PaUaPeWULc)z4z3z2z1d(])JeRSaUd\\ QXeVWiRQGeQeUaWiRQ:AQVZeU QXeU\\Figure 1: Overview of our approach. We combine a pre-trained retriever ( Query Encoder +Document\nIndex ) with a pre-trained seq2seq model ( Generator ) and ﬁne-tune end-to-end. For query x, we use\nMaximum Inner Product Search (MIPS) to ﬁnd the top-K documents zi. For ﬁnal prediction y, we\ntreat zas a latent variable and marginalize over seq2seq predictions given different documents.\nbut have only explored open-domain extractive question answering. Here, we bring hybrid parametric\nand non-parametric memory to the “workhorse of NLP,” i.e. sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models.\nWe endow pre-trained, parametric-memory generation models with a non-parametric memory through\na general-purpose ﬁne-tuning approach which we refer to as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).\nWe build RAG models where the parametric memory is a pre-trained seq2seq transformer, and the\nnon-parametric memory is a dense vector index of Wikipedia, accessed with a pre-trained neural\nretriever. We combine these components in a probabilistic model trained end-to-end (Fig. 1). The\nretriever (Dense Passage Retriever [ 26], henceforth DPR) provides latent documents conditioned on\nthe input, and the seq2seq model (BART [ 32]) then conditions on these latent documents together with\nthe input to generate the output. We marginalize the latent documents with a top-K approximation,\neither on a per-output basis (assuming the same document is responsible for all tokens) or a per-token\nbasis (where different documents are responsible for different tokens). Like T5 [ 51] or BART, RAG\ncan be ﬁne-tuned on any seq2seq task, whereby both the generator and retriever are jointly learned.\nThere has been extensive previous work proposing architectures to enrich systems with non-parametric\nmemory which are trained from scratch for speciﬁc tasks, e.g. memory networks [ 64,55], stack-\naugmented networks [ 25] and memory layers [ 30]. In contrast, we explore a setting where both\nparametric and non-parametric memory components are pre-trained and pre-loaded with extensive\nknowledge. Crucially, by using pre-trained access mechanisms, the ability to access knowledge is\npresent without additional training.\nOur results highlight the beneﬁts of combining parametric and non-parametric memory with genera-\ntion for knowledge-intensive tasks —tasks that humans could not reasonably be expected to perform\nwithout access to an external knowledge source. Our RAG models achieve state-of-the-art results\non open Natural Questions [ 29], WebQuestions [ 3] and CuratedTrec [ 2] and strongly outperform\nrecent approaches that use specialised pre-training objectives on TriviaQA [ 24]. Despite these being\nextractive tasks, we ﬁnd that unconstrained generation outperforms previous extractive approaches.\nFor knowledge-intensive generation, we experiment with MS-MARCO [ 1] and Jeopardy question\ngeneration, and we ﬁnd that our models generate responses that are more factual, speciﬁc, and\ndiverse than a BART baseline. For FEVER [ 56] fact veriﬁcation, we achieve results within 4.3% of\nstate-of-the-art pipeline models which use strong retrieval supervision. Finally, we demonstrate that\nthe non-parametric memory can be replaced to update the models’ knowledge as the world changes.1\n2 Methods\nWe explore RAG models, which use the input sequence xto retrieve text documents zand use them\nas additional context when generating the target sequence y. As shown in Figure 1, our models\nleverage two components: (i) a retriever p⌘(z|x)with parameters ⌘that returns (top-K truncated)\ndistributions over text passages given a query xand (ii) a generator p✓(yi|x, z, y 1:i1)parametrized\n1Code to run experiments with RAG has been open-sourced as part of the HuggingFace Transform-\ners Library [ 66] and can be found at https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/master/\nexamples/rag/ . An interactive demo of RAG models can be found at https://huggingface.co/rag/\n2\nby✓that generates a current token based on a context of the previous i1tokens y1:i1, the original\ninput xand a retrieved passage z.\nTo train the retriever and generator end-to-end, we treat the retrieved document as a latent variable.\nWe propose two models that marginalize over the latent documents in different ways to produce a\ndistribution over generated text. In one approach, RAG-Sequence , the model uses the same document\nto predict each target token. The second approach, RAG-Token , can predict each target token based\non a different document. In the following, we formally introduce both models and then describe the\np⌘andp✓components, as well as the training and decoding procedure.\n2.1 Models\nRAG-Sequence Model The RAG-Sequence model uses the same retrieved document to generate\nthe complete sequence . Technically, it treats the retrieved document as a single latent variable that\nis marginalized to get the seq2seq probability p(y|x)via a top-K approximation. Concretely, the\ntop K documents are retrieved using the retriever, and the generator produces the output sequence\nprobability for each document, which are then marginalized,\npRAG-Sequence (y|x)⇡X\nz2top-k(p(·|x))p⌘(z|x)p✓(y|x, z)=X\nz2top-k(p(·|x))p⌘(z|x)NY\nip✓(yi|x, z, y 1:i1)\nRAG-Token Model In the RAG-Token model we can draw a different latent document for each\ntarget token and marginalize accordingly. This allows the generator to choose content from several\ndocuments when producing an answer. Concretely, the top K documents are retrieved using the\nretriever, and then the generator produces a distribution for the next output token for each document,\nbefore marginalizing, and repeating the process with the following output token, Formally, we deﬁne:\npRAG-Token (y|x)⇡NY\niX\nz2top-k(p(·|x))p⌘(z|x)p✓(yi|x, z i,y1:i1)\nFinally, we note that RAG can be used for sequence classiﬁcation tasks by considering the target class\nas a target sequence of length one, in which case RAG-Sequence and RAG-Token are equivalent.\n2.2 Retriever: DPR\nThe retrieval component p⌘(z|x)is based on DPR [26]. DPR follows a bi-encoder architecture:\np⌘(z|x)/exp\nd(z)>q(x)\nd(z)=BERT d(z),q(x)=BERT q(x)\nwhere d(z)is a dense representation of a document produced by a BERT BASE document encoder [8],\nandq(x)a query representation produced by a query encoder , also based on BERT BASE. Calculating\ntop-k (p⌘(·|x)), the list of kdocuments zwith highest prior probability p⌘(z|x), is a Maximum Inner\nProduct Search (MIPS) problem, which can be approximately solved in sub-linear time [ 23]. We use\na pre-trained bi-encoder from DPR to initialize our retriever and to build the document index. This\nretriever was trained to retrieve documents which contain answers to TriviaQA [ 24] questions and\nNatural Questions [29]. We refer to the document index as the non-parametric memory .\n2.3 Generator: BART\nThe generator component p✓(yi|x, z, y 1:i1)could be modelled using any encoder-decoder. We use\nBART-large [ 32], a pre-trained seq2seq transformer [ 58] with 400M parameters. To combine the input\nxwith the retrieved content zwhen generating from BART, we simply concatenate them. BART was\npre-trained using a denoising objective and a variety of different noising functions. It has obtained\nstate-of-the-art results on a diverse set of generation tasks and outperforms comparably-sized T5\nmodels [32]. We refer to the BART generator parameters ✓as the parametric memory henceforth.\n2.4 Training\nWe jointly train the retriever and generator components without any direct supervision on what\ndocument should be retrieved. Given a ﬁne-tuning training corpus of input/output pairs (xj,yj), we\n3\nminimize the negative marginal log-likelihood of each target,P\njlogp(yj|xj)using stochastic\ngradient descent with Adam [ 28]. Updating the document encoder BERT dduring training is costly as\nit requires the document index to be periodically updated as REALM does during pre-training [ 20].\nWe do not ﬁnd this step necessary for strong performance, and keep the document encoder (and\nindex) ﬁxed, only ﬁne-tuning the query encoder BERT qand the BART generator.\n2.5 Decoding\nAt test time, RAG-Sequence and RAG-Token require different ways to approximate arg maxyp(y|x).\nRAG-Token The RAG-Token model can be seen as a standard, autoregressive seq2seq genera-\ntor with transition probability: p0\n✓(yi|x, y 1:i1)=P\nz2top-k(p(·|x))p⌘(zi|x)p✓(yi|x, z i,y1:i1)To\ndecode, we can plug p0\n✓(yi|x, y 1:i1)into a standard beam decoder.\nRAG-Sequence For RAG-Sequence, the likelihood p(y|x)does not break into a conventional per-\ntoken likelihood, hence we cannot solve it with a single beam search. Instead, we run beam search for\neach document z, scoring each hypothesis using p✓(yi|x, z, y 1:i1). This yields a set of hypotheses\nY, some of which may not have appeared in the beams of all documents. To estimate the probability\nof an hypothesis ywe run an additional forward pass for each document zfor which ydoes not\nappear in the beam, multiply generator probability with p⌘(z|x)and then sum the probabilities across\nbeams for the marginals. We refer to this decoding procedure as “Thorough Decoding.” For longer\noutput sequences, |Y|can become large, requiring many forward passes. For more efﬁcient decoding,\nwe can make a further approximation that p✓(y|x, z i)⇡0where ywas not generated during beam\nsearch from x, z i. This avoids the need to run additional forward passes once the candidate set Yhas\nbeen generated. We refer to this decoding procedure as “Fast Decoding.”\n3 Experiments\nWe experiment with RAG in a wide range of knowledge-intensive tasks. For all experiments, we use\na single Wikipedia dump for our non-parametric knowledge source. Following Lee et al. [31]and\nKarpukhin et al. [26], we use the December 2018 dump. Each Wikipedia article is split into disjoint\n100-word chunks, to make a total of 21M documents. We use the document encoder to compute an\nembedding for each document, and build a single MIPS index using FAISS [ 23] with a Hierarchical\nNavigable Small World approximation for fast retrieval [ 37]. During training, we retrieve the top\nkdocuments for each query. We consider k2{5,10}for training and set kfor test time using dev\ndata. We now discuss experimental details for each task.\n3.1 Open-domain Question Answering\nOpen-domain question answering (QA) is an important real-world application and common testbed\nfor knowledge-intensive tasks [ 20]. We treat questions and answers as input-output text pairs (x, y)\nand train RAG by directly minimizing the negative log-likelihood of answers. We compare RAG to\nthe popular extractive QA paradigm [ 5,7,31,26], where answers are extracted spans from retrieved\ndocuments, relying primarily on non-parametric knowledge. We also compare to “Closed-Book\nQA” approaches [ 52], which, like RAG, generate answers, but which do not exploit retrieval, instead\nrelying purely on parametric knowledge. We consider four popular open-domain QA datasets: Natural\nQuestions (NQ) [ 29], TriviaQA (TQA) [ 24]. WebQuestions (WQ) [ 3] and CuratedTrec (CT) [ 2]. As\nCT and WQ are small, we follow DPR [ 26] by initializing CT and WQ models with our NQ RAG\nmodel. We use the same train/dev/test splits as prior work [ 31,26] and report Exact Match (EM)\nscores. For TQA, to compare with T5 [52], we also evaluate on the TQA Wiki test set.\n3.2 Abstractive Question Answering\nRAG models can go beyond simple extractive QA and answer questions with free-form, abstractive\ntext generation. To test RAG’s natural language generation (NLG) in a knowledge-intensive setting,\nwe use the MSMARCO NLG task v2.1 [ 43]. The task consists of questions, ten gold passages\nretrieved from a search engine for each question, and a full sentence answer annotated from the\nretrieved passages. We do not use the supplied passages, only the questions and answers, to treat\n4\nMSMARCO as an open-domain abstractive QA task. MSMARCO has some questions that cannot be\nanswered in a way that matches the reference answer without access to the gold passages, such as\n“What is the weather in Volcano, CA?” so performance will be lower without using gold passages.\nWe also note that some MSMARCO questions cannot be answered using Wikipedia alone. Here,\nRAG can rely on parametric knowledge to generate reasonable responses.\n3.3 Jeopardy Question Generation\nTo evaluate RAG’s generation abilities in a non-QA setting, we study open-domain question gen-\neration. Rather than use questions from standard open-domain QA tasks, which typically consist\nof short, simple questions, we propose the more demanding task of generating Jeopardy questions.\nJeopardy is an unusual format that consists of trying to guess an entity from a fact about that entity.\nFor example, “The World Cup” is the answer to the question “In 1986 Mexico scored as the ﬁrst\ncountry to host this international sports competition twice.” As Jeopardy questions are precise,\nfactual statements, generating Jeopardy questions conditioned on their answer entities constitutes a\nchallenging knowledge-intensive generation task.\nWe use the splits from SearchQA [ 10], with 100K train, 14K dev, and 27K test examples. As\nthis is a new task, we train a BART model for comparison. Following [ 67], we evaluate using the\nSQuAD-tuned Q-BLEU-1 metric [ 42]. Q-BLEU is a variant of BLEU with a higher weight for\nmatching entities and has higher correlation with human judgment for question generation than\nstandard metrics. We also perform two human evaluations, one to assess generation factuality, and\none for speciﬁcity. We deﬁne factuality as whether a statement can be corroborated by trusted external\nsources, and speciﬁcity as high mutual dependence between the input and output [ 33]. We follow\nbest practice and use pairwise comparative evaluation [ 34]. Evaluators are shown an answer and two\ngenerated questions, one from BART and one from RAG. They are then asked to pick one of four\noptions—quuestion A is better, question B is better, both are good, or neither is good.\n3.4 Fact Veriﬁcation\nFEVER [ 56] requires classifying whether a natural language claim is supported or refuted by\nWikipedia, or whether there is not enough information to decide. The task requires retrieving\nevidence from Wikipedia relating to the claim and then reasoning over this evidence to classify\nwhether the claim is true, false, or unveriﬁable from Wikipedia alone. FEVER is a retrieval problem\ncoupled with an challenging entailment reasoning task. It also provides an appropriate testbed for\nexploring the RAG models’ ability to handle classiﬁcation rather than generation. We map FEVER\nclass labels (supports, refutes, or not enough info) to single output tokens and directly train with\nclaim-class pairs. Crucially, unlike most other approaches to FEVER, we do not use supervision on\nretrieved evidence. In many real-world applications, retrieval supervision signals aren’t available, and\nmodels that do not require such supervision will be applicable to a wider range of tasks. We explore\ntwo variants: the standard 3-way classiﬁcation task (supports/refutes/not enough info) and the 2-way\n(supports/refutes) task studied in Thorne and Vlachos [57]. In both cases we report label accuracy.\n4 Results\n4.1 Open-domain Question Answering\nTable 1 shows results for RAG along with state-of-the-art models. On all four open-domain QA\ntasks, RAG sets a new state of the art (only on the T5-comparable split for TQA). RAG combines\nthe generation ﬂexibility of the “closed-book” (parametric only) approaches and the performance of\n\"open-book\" retrieval-based approaches. Unlike REALM and T5+SSM, RAG enjoys strong results\nwithout expensive, specialized “salient span masking” pre-training [ 20]. It is worth noting that RAG’s\nretriever is initialized using DPR’s retriever, which uses retrieval supervision on Natural Questions\nand TriviaQA. RAG compares favourably to the DPR QA system, which uses a BERT-based “cross-\nencoder” to re-rank documents, along with an extractive reader. RAG demonstrates that neither a\nre-ranker nor extractive reader is necessary for state-of-the-art performance.\nThere are several advantages to generating answers even when it is possible to extract them.

Furthermore, RAG can generate correct answers\neven when the correct answer is not in any retrieved document, achieving 11.8% accuracy in such\ncases for NQ, where an extractive model would score 0%.\n4.2 Abstractive Question Answering\nAs shown in Table 2, RAG-Sequence outperforms BART on Open MS-MARCO NLG by 2.6 Bleu\npoints and 2.6 Rouge-L points. RAG approaches state-of-the-art model performance, which is\nimpressive given that (i) those models access gold passages with speciﬁc information required to\ngenerate the reference answer, (ii) many questions are unanswerable without the gold passages, and\n(iii) not all questions are answerable from Wikipedia alone. Table 3 shows some generated answers\nfrom our models. Qualitatively, we ﬁnd that RAG models hallucinate less and generate factually\ncorrect text more often than BART. Later, we also show that RAG generations are more diverse than\nBART generations (see §4.5).\n4.3 Jeopardy Question Generation\nTable 2 shows that RAG-Token performs better than RAG-Sequence on Jeopardy question generation,\nwith both models outperforming BART on Q-BLEU-1. Table 4 shows human evaluation results, over\n452 pairs of generations from BART and RAG-Token. Evaluators indicated that BART was more\nfactual than RAG in only 7.1% of cases, while RAG was more factual in 42.7% of cases, and both\nRAG and BART were factual in a further 17% of cases, clearly demonstrating the effectiveness of\nRAG on the task over a state-of-the-art generation model. Evaluators also ﬁnd RAG generations to\nbe more speciﬁc by a large margin. Table 3 shows typical generations from each model.\nJeopardy questions often contain two separate pieces of information, and RAG-Token may perform\nbest because it can generate responses that combine content from several documents. Figure 2 shows\nan example. When generating “Sun”, the posterior is high for document 2 which mentions “The\nSun Also Rises”. Similarly, document 1 dominates the posterior when “A Farewell to Arms” is\ngenerated. Intriguingly, after the ﬁrst token of each book is generated, the document posterior ﬂattens.\nThis observation suggests that the generator can complete the titles without depending on speciﬁc\ndocuments. In other words, the model’s parametric knowledge is sufﬁcient to complete the titles. We\nﬁnd evidence for this hypothesis by feeding the BART-only baseline with the partial decoding \"The\nSun. BART completes the generation \"The SunAlso Rises\" isanovel bythis author of\"The Sun\nAlso Rises\" indicating the title \"The Sun Also Rises\" is stored in BART’s parameters. Similarly,\nBART will complete the partial decoding \"The SunAlso Rises\" isanovel bythis author of\"A\nwith \"The SunAlso Rises\" isanovel bythis author of\"AFarewell toArms\" . This example shows\nhow parametric and non-parametric memories work together —the non-parametric component helps\nto guide the generation, drawing out speciﬁc knowledge stored in the parametric memory.\n4.4 Fact Veriﬁcation\nTable 2 shows our results on FEVER. For 3-way classiﬁcation, RAG scores are within 4.3% of\nstate-of-the-art models, which are complex pipeline systems with domain-speciﬁc architectures and\nsubstantial engineering, trained using intermediate retrieval supervision, which RAG does not require.\n6\nDocument 1: his works are considered classics of Americanliterature ...

RAG achieves an accuracy\nwithin 2.7% of this model, despite being supplied with only the claim and retrieving its own evidence.\nWe also analyze whether documents retrieved by RAG correspond to documents annotated as gold\nevidence in FEVER. We calculate the overlap in article titles between the top kdocuments retrieved\nby RAG and gold evidence annotations. We ﬁnd that the top retrieved document is from a gold article\nin 71% of cases, and a gold article is present in the top 10 retrieved articles in 90% of cases.\n4.5 Additional Results\nGeneration Diversity Section 4.3 shows that RAG models are more factual and speciﬁc than\nBART for Jeopardy question generation. Following recent work on diversity-promoting decoding\n[33,59,39], we also investigate generation diversity by calculating the ratio of distinct ngrams to\ntotal ngrams generated by different models. Table 5 shows that RAG-Sequence’s generations are\nmore diverse than RAG-Token’s, and both are signiﬁcantly more diverse than BART without needing\nany diversity-promoting decoding.\nRetrieval Ablations A key feature of RAG is learning to retrieve relevant information for the task.\nTo assess the effectiveness of the retrieval mechanism, we run ablations where we freeze the retriever\nduring training. As shown in Table 6, learned retrieval improves results for all tasks. We compare\nRAG’s dense retriever to a word overlap-based BM25 retriever [ 53]. Here, we replace RAG’s retriever\nwith a ﬁxed BM25 system, and use BM25 retrieval scores as logits when calculating p(z|x). Table\n6 show the results. For FEVER, BM25 performs best, perhaps since FEVER claims are heavily\nentity-centric and thus well-suited for word overlap-based retrieval. Differentiable retrieval improves\nresults on all other tasks, especially for Open-Domain QA, where it is crucial.\nIndex hot-swapping An advantage of non-parametric memory models like RAG is that knowledge\ncan be easily updated at test time. Parametric-only models like T5 or BART need further training to\nupdate their behavior as the world changes. To demonstrate, we build an index using the DrQA [ 5]\nWikipedia dump from December 2016 and compare outputs from RAG using this index to the newer\nindex from our main results (December 2018). We prepare a list of 82 world leaders who had changed\nbetween these dates and use a template “Who is {position}?” (e.g. “Who is the President of Peru?”)\n7\nTable 4: Human assessments for the Jeopardy\nQuestion Generation Task.\nFactuality Speciﬁcity\nBART better 7.1% 16.8%\nRAG better 42.7% 37.4%\nBoth good 11.7% 11.8%\nBoth poor 17.7% 6.9%\nNo majority 20.8% 20.1%Table 5: Ratio of distinct to total tri-grams for\ngeneration tasks.\nMSMARCO Jeopardy QGen\nGold 89.6% 90.0%\nBART 70.7% 32.4%\nRAG-Token 77.8% 46.8%\nRAG-Seq. 83.5% 53.8%\nTable 6: Ablations on the dev set.

RAG answers 70% correctly using the 2016 index for\n2016 world leaders and 68% using the 2018 index for 2018 world leaders. Accuracy with mismatched\nindices is low (12% with the 2018 index and 2016 leaders, 4% with the 2016 index and 2018 leaders).\nThis shows we can update RAG’s world knowledge by simply replacing its non-parametric memory.\nEffect of Retrieving more documents Models are trained with either 5 or 10 retrieved latent\ndocuments, and we do not observe signiﬁcant differences in performance between them. We have the\nﬂexibility to adjust the number of retrieved documents at test time, which can affect performance and\nruntime. Figure 3 (left) shows that retrieving more documents at test time monotonically improves\nOpen-domain QA results for RAG-Sequence, but performance peaks for RAG-Token at 10 retrieved\ndocuments. Figure 3 (right) shows that retrieving more documents leads to higher Rouge-L for\nRAG-Token at the expense of Bleu-1, but the effect is less pronounced for RAG-Sequence.\n1020304050KR e t r i e v e dD o c s394041424344NQ Exact MatchRAG-TokRAG-Seq1020304050KR e t r i e v e dD o c s4050607080NQ Answer Recall @ KRAG-TokRAG-SeqFixed DPRBM251020304050KR e t r i e v e dD o c s4850525456Bleu-1 / Rouge-L scoreRAG-Tok R-LRAG-Tok B-1RAG-Seq R-LRAG-Seq B-1Figure 3: Left: NQ performance as more documents are retrieved.

Such tasks include open-domain question answering [ 5,29],\nfact checking [ 56], fact completion [ 48], long-form question answering [ 12], Wikipedia article\ngeneration [ 36], dialogue [ 41,65,9,13], translation [ 17], and language modeling [ 19,27]. Our\nwork uniﬁes previous successes in incorporating retrieval into individual tasks, showing that a single\nretrieval-based architecture is capable of achieving strong performance across several tasks.\n8\nGeneral-Purpose Architectures for NLP Prior work on general-purpose architectures for NLP\ntasks has shown great success without the use of retrieval. A single, pre-trained language model\nhas been shown to achieve strong performance on various classiﬁcation tasks in the GLUE bench-\nmarks [ 60,61] after ﬁne-tuning [ 49,8]. GPT-2 [ 50] later showed that a single, left-to-right, pre-trained\nlanguage model could achieve strong performance across both discriminative and generative tasks.\nFor further improvement, BART [ 32] and T5 [ 51,52] propose a single, pre-trained encoder-decoder\nmodel that leverages bi-directional attention to achieve stronger performance on discriminative\nand generative tasks. Our work aims to expand the space of possible tasks with a single, uniﬁed\narchitecture, by learning a retrieval module to augment pre-trained, generative language models.\nLearned Retrieval There is signiﬁcant work on learning to retrieve documents in information\nretrieval, more recently with pre-trained, neural language models [ 44,26] similar to ours. Some\nwork optimizes the retrieval module to aid in a speciﬁc, downstream task such as question answering,\nusing search [ 46], reinforcement learning [ 6,63,62], or a latent variable approach [ 31,20] as in our\nwork. These successes leverage different retrieval-based architectures and optimization techniques to\nachieve strong performance on a single task, while we show that a single retrieval-based architecture\ncan be ﬁne-tuned for strong performance on a variety of tasks.\nMemory-based Architectures Our document index can be seen as a large external memory for\nneural networks to attend to, analogous to memory networks [ 64,55]. Concurrent work [ 14] learns\nto retrieve a trained embedding for each entity in the input, rather than to retrieve raw text as in our\nwork. Other work improves the ability of dialog models to generate factual text by attending over\nfact embeddings [ 9,13] or, closer to our work, over retrieved text directly [ 15]. A key feature of our\nmemory is that it is comprised of raw text rather distributed representations, which makes the memory\nboth (i) human-readable, lending a form of interpretability to our model, and (ii) human-writable,\nenabling us to dynamically update the model’s memory by editing the document index.\nRetrieve-and-Edit approaches Our method shares some similarities with retrieve-and-edit style\napproaches, where a similar training input-output pair is retrieved for a given input, and then edited\nto provide a ﬁnal output. These approaches have proved successful in a number of domains including\nMachine Translation [ 18,22] and Semantic Parsing [ 21]. Our approach does have several differences,\nincluding less of emphasis on lightly editing a retrieved item, but on aggregating content from several\npieces of retrieved content, as well as learning latent retrieval, and retrieving evidence documents\nrather than related training pairs. This said, RAG techniques may work well in these settings, and\ncould represent promising future work.\n6 Discussion\nIn this work, we presented hybrid generation models with access to parametric and non-parametric\nmemory. We showed that our RAG models obtain state of the art results on open-domain QA. We\nfound that people prefer RAG’s generation over purely parametric BART, ﬁnding RAG more factual\nand speciﬁc. We conducted an thorough investigation of the learned retrieval component, validating\nits effectiveness, and we illustrated how the retrieval index can be hot-swapped to update the model\nwithout requiring any retraining. In future work, it may be fruitful to investigate if the two components\ncan be jointly pre-trained from scratch, either with a denoising objective similar to BART or some\nanother objective. Our work opens up new research directions on how parametric and non-parametric\nmemories interact and how to most effectively combine them, showing promise in being applied to a\nwide variety of NLP tasks.\n9\nBroader Impact\nThis work offers several positive societal beneﬁts over previous work: the fact that it is more\nstrongly grounded in real factual knowledge (in this case Wikipedia) makes it “hallucinate” less\nwith generations that are more factual, and offers more control and interpretability. RAG could be\nemployed in a wide variety of scenarios with direct beneﬁt to society, for example by endowing it\nwith a medical index and asking it open-domain questions on that topic, or by helping people be more\neffective at their jobs.\nWith these advantages also come potential downsides: Wikipedia, or any potential external knowledge\nsource, will probably never be entirely factual and completely devoid of bias. Since RAG can be\nemployed as a language model, similar concerns as for GPT-2 [ 50] are valid here, although arguably\nto a lesser extent, including that it might be used to generate abuse, faked or misleading content in\nthe news or on social media; to impersonate others; or to automate the production of spam/phishing\ncontent [ 54]. Advanced language models may also lead to the automation of various jobs in the\ncoming decades [ 16]. In order to mitigate these risks, AI systems could be employed to ﬁght against\nmisleading content and automated spam/phishing.\nAcknowledgments\nThe authors would like to thank the reviewers for their thoughtful and constructive feedback on this\npaper, as well as HuggingFace for their help in open-sourcing code to run RAG models.

The proof of concept uses\nparallel patterns to define parallelism and apply static global op-\ntimizations automatically. Most notably, an assignment between\ntasklets and the provided heterogeneous cluster architecture is\ncalculated during compile time, the new code generator creates a\nsource file combining shared-memory, distributed-memory, and\naccelerator offloading according to the generated mapping.\nThe prototype successfully optimizes and compiles most Rodinia\nbenchmarks.

To con-\ntinue satisfying the increasing computational demands, systems are\nequipped with specialized hardware like GPUs to leverage higher\nthroughputs and energy efficiency than generic CPUs. Similarly,\nmultiple levels of memory are used to satisfy the ever-increasing\ndata demands. The installation of the Frontier system at the Oak\nRidge National Laboratory marks the first exa-scale system, utiliz-\ning a heterogeneous GPU system with NUMA CPUs [ 13]. Given this\nheterogeneity, the development of efficient and portable scientific\ncodes is increasingly challenging. This challenge in heterogeneity\nis often approached by HPC performance engineers, introducing\ntypical challenges in the knowledge transfer toward domain scien-\ntists. Thus, limiting the long-term maintainability and extensibility\nof an application by the domain scientist.\nOne approach for improving maintainability while providing per-\nformance and portability are hardware-specific compiler optimiza-\ntions. The PPLprovides such an approach with a high-level, descrip-\ntive pattern language. It statically applies application-wide (global)\noptimizations including the assignment of parallel workloads to\nthe targeted architecture as introduced in previous work [ 32,47].\nTo perform those global optimizations, the intermediate represen-\ntation ( IR) provides as much information as possible by applying\nparallel patterns. Previous work [ 43] already introduced a high-\nlevel IR, defining the semantic understanding of parallelism and\ndata flow for specific parallel patterns.\nThis work introduces a code generator of the PPLtool completing\nthe entire prototypical toolchain. The provided code generator\nfollows a source-to-source approach generating optimized parallel\nsource code for shared-, distributed-memory, and GPU offloading.\nThe completed prototype implementation is further evaluated\nagainst the Rodinia benchmark suite [ 8], covering typical HPC ap-\nplications. The measurement setup consists of the original OpenMP\nversion as a baseline, a single CPU node, and a distributed setup\nwith CPUs and GPUs. Furthermore, a port of the LULESH [ 21]\nproxy-app is discussed as a benchmark for scalability. Based on the\nevaluation, the current state of the prototype is assessed highlight-\ning issues regarding the current Linear Programming ( LP) based\nglobal optimization and the code generator. The path towards a\nproductized version is drafted.\n32\nDownloaded from the ACM Digital Library on April 13, 2025.\n\nPMAM ’24, March 3, 2024, Edinburgh, United Kingdom Schmitz et al.\nThe following main contributions are provided with this work:\n•The implementation of a code generator for the PPLproto-\ntype tool toolchain.\n•A prototypical implementation of inlining and loop unrolling\nfor the Abstract Pattern Tree (APT).\n•An evaluation of the tool/concept against nearly all kernels\nfrom the Rodinia benchmark suite.\n•A port of the LULESH proxy-app to the PPL.\n•An analysis of the current issues of the PPL prototype in-\ncluding possible solutions for a release version.\nThe remainder of this work is structured as follows. Section 2\nprovides an overview of related work regarding the PPL. A brief ex-\nplanation on the existing toolchain is presented in Section 3. While\nSection 4 introduces the new code generator and the APT inlining,\nSection 5 evaluates the PPLtoolchain against the existing OpenMP\nimplementation of Rodinia. Finally, the results are concluded and\nan outlook on future work is provided in Section 7.\n2 Related Work\nRecurring structures for the parallelization of hotspots can be found\nin most parallel algorithms. Many well-known programming mod-\nels make use of such patterns including OpenMP [ 39], MPI [ 34],\nand CUDA [11].\nThe automatic optimization of parallel programs is tackled in\ndifferent ways by many. In most cases, they focus on specific fields\nfor optimization, such as polyhedral compilers [ 15,30,33] to op-\ntimize polyhedral loop nests, Korali [ 28] for Bayesian uncertainty\nand stochastic, or Halide [ 35] for image processing. Especially GPU\ncode is often optimized by specialized compiler, such as the work\nof Pai et al. [ 41] focusing on graph algorithms. The PPLapproach\ntargets a broader range of applications and hardware by separating\nthe parallel semantics from the usable hardware while leaving the\ndegree of parallelism and utilization to the optimization.\nIn contrast to the wide spread production code generators in-\ncluded in LLVM [ 23] and gcc [ 12] the PPL does not generate as-\nsembly directly. Instead the PPLtool is a source to source compiler,\ngenerating C++ code compatible with any C++17 capable com-\npiler. Thus, combined with the preferred C++ compiler to generate\nassembly a toolchain is constructed.\nThe source to source transpilation is also a well known aspect\nof software engineering, simplifying the porting process to more\nrecent technologies, such as C2Rust [ 45] which transforms C99\ncode into Rust. In contrast to the porting aspect of the transcompil-\ners the PPLutilizes a custom Domain Specific Language ( DSL) to\nenable specific optimization, instead of a syntactical transformation\nbetween two predefined languages.\nCode generation and DSL frameworks are well established tools\napplied for simulations and are highly tuned for very specific ap-\nplication. For example, OpenSBLI [ 27] generates fluid dynamics\ncode on unstructured grids for heterogeneous architectures. The\nwork of Kempf et al.[22] provides a code generator for the discon-\ntinuous galerkin method to apply vectorization. The PPLaims to\nprovide a much wider applicability, focusing on an entire appli-\ncation when generating optimized code. Lift [ 44] utilizes parallel\npatterns specified in OpenCL [ 38] to optimize and generate GPU\ncode. In contrast, the PPLalso provides support for shared memory\nand distributed memory systems. Tools like YASK [ 50] or the work\nof Li et al. [ 25] only generate code for optimized stencil kernels intheir DSL approach. The PPLhowever supports the map, reduction,\nand stencil patterns allowing a broader range of applications to\nbenefit from the approach. Furthermore, most of the applied code\ngeneration frameworks only generate individual kernels to be used\nin conjunction with existing applications for management. The\nPPLfollows a more holistic approach with its code generation by\ngenerating the entire application.\nSkeleton libraries [ 10] like Müsli [ 9] follow a similar approach\nof lifting parallelism as a reusable set of instructions. Libraries like\nThrust [ 37] or the Intel thread building blocks [ 20] add to the vendor\ndriven skeleton libraries. Microsoft parallel pattern library [ 48]\nalso directly applies the notion of parallel patterns in their library.\nKokkos [ 46] and Raja [ 24] pursue an approach covering a complete\nnode. Such libraries often only consider a single node while the\nPPLtargets a complete cluster system including shared memory,\noffloading, and distributed memory.\nSDFGs and the DaCe tool [ 4,5] follow a rule-based optimiza-\ntion strategy to apply possible optimizations to hotspots in the\ncomputation. These optimizations need to be defined by an HPC\nexpert once and can then be performed either automatically or\nsemi-automatically in the SDFG interface. By allowing more free-\ndom during the optimization and mapping process, the PPLtool\nmight find solutions not yet proposed. Especially application wide\noptimizations might be considered, while the SDFGs focus more\non local optimizations.\nThe Legion framework [ 3] targets the same system configura-\ntions as the PPL, including CPUs, GPUs, and distributed memory.\nIn contrast to the PPL, the focus of Legion is the framework itself\nand enabling user-defined mappings while this work tries to enable\nautomatic global optimizations.\n3 Parallel Pattern Language Prototype\nThe PPL prototype is a full toolchain to verify the applicability\nof the proposed pattern-based approach to real-world problems\nand environments. The authors have already shown that many\nalgorithms can be represented using such parallel patterns [ 43].\nThe current prototypical toolchain is constructed as a modular\nsource-to-source compiler with five stages:\n1. Parsing: Evaluation of the user input.\n•DSL: Application sources using parallel patterns.\n•Hardware Language ( HWL ): JSON description of the tar-\nget cluster hardware.\n2. APT Generation: Statically generates the hierarchical APT\nrepresentation of the algorithm.\n3.Optimization: Perform global optimizations on the APT, e.g.,\nreordering and explicit hardware mapping.\n4.Abstract Mapping Tree ( AMT ) Generation: Generate an\nAMT from the optimization results to add necessary syn-\nchronization and data transfers.\n5.Code Generation: Generate optimized C++ code from the\nAMT.\nThe first four stages are already discussed by the authors [ 32,\n43,47], and a brief overview is provided in this section. The new\ncode generator and an implementation of function-inlining/loop-\nunrolling on the APT are introduced in Section 4. An overview is\navailable on our public GitHub1.\n1https://github.com/RWTH-HPC/PPL/\n33\nDownloaded from the ACM Digital Library on April 13, 2025.\n\nParallel Pattern Language PMAM ’24, March 3, 2024, Edinburgh, United Kingdom\n1 // Pattern : multiply every element in input by x and store it\nin output\n2 map multX ([ Int ] input , Int x) : [ Int ] output {\n3 output [ INDEX ] = input [ INDEX ] * x\n4 }\n5\n6 // Pattern : subtract every element in input by x and store it\nin output\n7 map subX ([ Int ] input , Int x) : [ Int ] output {\n8 output [ INDEX ] = input [ INDEX ] - x\n9 }\n10\n11 seq main (): Int {// program entry point\n12 var [ Int ] x = init_List ([4096]) // Array with 4096 elements\n13 var [ Int ] y = init_List ([4096]) // Array with 4096 elements\n14\n15 y = multX <<<>>>(x, 2) // perform multX from x to y\n16 x = subX <<<>>>(y, 1) // perform subX from y to x\n17\n18 ... // some other computations with x\n19 }\nListing 1. Two data dependant map patterns performing a\nmultiplication and a subtraction on each element of an array\n3.1 Parsing\nDefining a custom DSL is a relatively fast way of developing and\ntesting an approach encompassing a global view on an application.\nNevertheless, the DSL is capable of representing most applications\nwith a few limitations to reduce the development effort [ 43]. The\nDSL follow a mathematic-algorithmic approach, applying a CUDA\ninspired notation to highlight the element-wise definition of parallel\npatterns. The frontend makes use of parallel patterns by integrating\nthem directly into the language via two main components:\nParallel pattern calls define the entry point for a parallel pattern.\nExamples of parallel pattern calls are in Lines 15 and 16 of Listing 1.\nParallel pattern definitions define the actual computation that\nincludes which parallel pattern is used. An example can be found\nin Lines 2-4 and 7-9 in Listing 1.\nThis in turn allows the exploration of an optimal partitioning of\nmultiple parallel patterns based on the target hardware. The current\nDSL requires statically defined array sizes compared to typical\nmalloc-based pointer arithmetic and focuses on pure functions.\nThe static array lengths enable the PPL to derive the size of a\nparallel pattern since the DSL does not follow a loop-based structure\nlike OpenMP. The limitation to pure functions simplifies the data\ndependency analysis significantly since actual dependencies cannot\nbe hidden via aliasing or global variables.\nListing 1 depicts an example in the DSL frontend, computing\n𝑥=2∗𝑥−1for each element in the array x. Variable ydefines\nthe result from the multiplication as an interim result for each\narray element (see Lines 15,16). The computations are defined in\nLines 2-4 and 7-9 respectively. INDEX states that the computation\nis performed for every element in the given arrays.\nTheHWL allows a definition of execution units by the program-\nmer. These execution units can be an arbitrary number of cores\nevenly dividing the original device. For example a device with\ntwelve cores execution units spanning twelve, six, four, three, two,\nand one core are possible.\n3.2 APT Generation\nTheAPT is a high-level hierarchical representation of parallel code.\nAll nodes fall into two distinct categories:\n•Expressions: Defining fixed computations, e.g., 𝑎=𝑏+𝑐.•Statements: Defining control-flow and spanning a local vari-\nable scope, e.g., loops. All nodes defined in this scope are\ndescendants of this node.\nAs special cases, function calls count as expressions, referencing the\nsub-APT of a function to limit memory consumption. Pattern calls\nare statements defining a parallel control-flow. The corresponding\npartial APT can be expanded for further analysis.\nThe limitation toward linear array accesses within parallel pat-\nterns allows the compiler to derive fine-grained data dependencies\nstatically. All data dependencies must be related to an expression,\nsince only those nodes are able to perform computations. The avail-\nable dependencies can be passed to its ancestors as long as the\naccessed data element is still within scope, allowing a dependency\nanalysis on multiple levels.\nThePPL derives the APT from an abstract syntax tree by lifting\nthe semantic information on parallel patterns. The representation\nof parallel patterns allows optimization preprocessing, such as parti-\ntioning the patterns. The size of these partitioned patterns (tasklets)\nis currently a static parameter defined by the user.\n3.3 Global Optimization\nGlobal optimizations are changes applied on an application level,\nlike loop fusion or data flow optimizations between devices [ 32].\nThe PPL uses algorithmic efficiencies, the synchronization ,inter -\nandintra-processor dataflow efficiencies , to evaluate potential map-\npings and optimizations during compile time [31, 32].\n1.Synchronization efficiency: Minimize dependency based syn-\nchronization.\n2.Inter-processor dataflow efficiency: Minimize the runtime of\ntasks𝑇on a set of execution units 𝐸.\n•Network Cost: Minimize data transfer time.\n•Execution Cost: Minimize execution time.\n3.Intra-processor dataflow efficiency: Maximize data reuse on\nthe same execution unit.\nEach efficiency describes a step in the global optimization\npipeline. The synchronization efficiency utilizes the dataflow to\noptimize the APT by reordering it into steps. Each node within\nStep𝑛+1must have a data dependency towards a node in the\nprior Step𝑛. Nodes without any input dependency, such as data\ninitialization, are placed in Step 0. This ordering maximizes the\namount of parallelism available with data-independent tasklets by\nremoving the unnecessary sequential ordering.\nThe Inter-processor dataflow efficiency defines an optimization\nproblem to minimize the codependent network and execution costs.\nThe current implementation [ 47] approximates the complete prob-\nlem by iterating over the steps generated by the synchronization\nefficiency . Each step is optimized based on the previous step and a\nlookahead over the next 𝑛steps. The execution cost is estimated\nusing an adapted Roofline Model [ 49]. The network cost is esti-\nmated by the available bandwidth/latency and the corresponding\ndata. The resulting makespan-optimization utilizes the static infor-\nmation provided by the PPL, tasklets, and hardware and defines a\nMixed Integer Linear Program ( MILP ). To solve the corresponding\nMILP representation, the Gurobi solver [ 16] is applied. Gurobi is a\nprominent proprietary solver for linear-programming. Since MILP s\nare limited in their support for uncertainties, the support for nested\nparallel patterns is restricted to allow optimizations for a subset of\nproblems.\n34\nDownloaded from the ACM Digital Library on April 13, 2025.\n\nPMAM ’24, March 3, 2024, Edinburgh, United Kingdom Schmitz et al.\nThe Intra-processor dataflow efficiency targets the mapping gen-\nerated from the Inter-processor dataflow efficiency . Tasklets on the\nsame execution unit are ordered, or fused if possible, to improve\ncaching.\n3.4 AMT Generation\nThe AMT extends the APT by including the optimizations and\nmapping data from the previous stage. Thus, the APT is a single\nCPU representation, while the AMT is a heterogeneous, distributed\nand concurrent representation. The assignments can be integrated\nas a parameter per tasklet and are a direct representation of the\nmapping results. The data structure is extended to include the\nrepresentation of tasklets, assignments to specific groups of cores\ndefined in the hardware language as cache groups, new nodes to\nrepresent synchronization and data transfers, and special nodes\nfor offloaded parallel patterns and GPU memory management.\nData transfer and synchronization extensions are derived from\nthe dataflow and mapping information iteratively.\nFirst, the global optimization may assign multiple tasklets stem-\nming from the same parallel pattern onto the same GPU, by group-\ning them, the GPU utilization is improved and synchronization\nreduced. The data management and synchronization is generated\niteratively by deriving the sequential order of the computations\nfrom the data flow. Depending on the \"distance\" between the exe-\ncution units and the access type, three classes are derived:\n1.Device local dependencies can be solved by only synchro-\nnizing, assuming shared memory systems, enabling pattern-\nindependent read and write accesses.\n2.Remote write accesses do not need any synchronization,\nsince they do not risk a write-after-write data race on sep-\narated device memory (disregarding unified memory and\nRMA operations). In this case, it is sufficient to invalidate\nany copies of the written data, setting the only valid location\nthe data available at to the current device.\n3.Remote read accesses require synchronization and data\ntransfers between the owner of a local copy and the device\nrequesting the data. By creating a new copy of the data on\nanother device, further read accesses can utilize a potentially\ncloser device to access the same data. This, at the cost of an\nincreased memory footprint, can reduce the network traffic.\nDue to their limited memory capacity, GPUs only hold data required\nby subsequent computations.\n4 Code Generator\nThe code generator has a significant influence on the performance\nof a source-to-source compiler. For the first complete proof of con-\ncept, the goal is not to derive the best runtime from the get-go,\nbut rather to discover flaws and bottlenecks in the approach and\nenabling future improvements. Following the concept of globally\noptimizing code for a heterogeneous system, any possible imple-\nmentation needs to support the following features to represent the\noptimization as closely as possible:\n1.Support for shared, distributed memory, and offloading pro-\ngramming models.\n2. Pinning of workload to individual execution units.\n3. Data movement across all devices.\n4.Synchronization between any two execution units in the\nsystem.5.Implementation of all supported patterns for each target\narchitecture.\nThe provided implementation is aligned to all of these features. The\nPPLprototype utilizes a combination of PThreads [ 36], MPI [ 34],\nand CUDA [ 11] to feature their respective programming models\ncovering the first constraint.\nThe assignment of work to individual execution units required\na complete thread pool implementation since both the individual\nassignments of tasklets and the explicit synchronization between\nchanging sets of cores is not available in existing approaches suffi-\nciently. For instance, in OpenMP it is not possible to assign tasklets\nto specific cores explicitly, which is required to fully support the des-\nignated optimizations. The thread pool runs on each node covering\nthe shared and distributed memory domains. For GPU offloading,\nassigning work to individual cores works against the inherent struc-\nture of GPUs and therefore dropped. Instead, the GPU is always\nregarded as a single execution unit, limiting potential serialization\nand improving the hardware utilization for GPU tasklets.\nTo simplify the data transfers and avoid relying on specific\nCUDA-aware MPI implementations, data exchanges are separated\ninto two levels: CPU-CPU and CPU-GPU. This separation allows in-\ndependent implementations via MPI and CUDA respectively while\nenabling data transfers between distributed GPUs with a combina-\ntion.\nSimilarly, synchronization needs to be handled on three different\nlevels to cover the hierarchical structure of the hardware. Intra-\ndevice covers the synchronization on a single device. On the CPU\nthe thread pool covers intra-device synchronization. On the GPU,\nexcept for the implicit synchronization with a reduction pattern,\nwhich required a complete implementation of the reduction in\nCUDA for all supported combiner functions. Intra-device synchro-\nnization is not necessary since the GPU is not divided into further\nexecution units as stated before. The intra-node synchronization\nhandles the synchronization of all accelerators with the host. The\ncode generator employs CUDA and the thread pool to synchronize\nthe CPU and GPUs on a single node. The generated code makes\nuse of blocking end-to-end communication since the optimization\nonly requires synchronization for data dependencies, implying a\nprevious or subsequent data transfer. The implementation of each\nparallel pattern is supported using the thread pool and CUDA. MPI\nis not directly required for the calculation except the reduction\npattern.\n4.1 Shared Memory\nTo fully utilize the results provided by the global optimization, the\ncode generator needs to be able to directly assign tasklets to an\nexecution unit defined in the hardware language. These execution\nunits can theoretically be chosen to cover anything between a sin-\ngle hardware thread up to the whole CPU. To properly evaluate the\nnecessity of such a fine granular optimization, the code generator\nneeds the ability to respect those degrees of freedom. A possible\nassignment of workload to a specific thread/core is required. Task-\ning distorts the evaluation of the proof of concept via dynamic\nload balancing and thus cannot be employed yet. The integration\nof dynamic load balancing might still be a reasonable approach to\ncover problems that cannot be properly analyzed during compile\ntime, e.g., graph algorithms or adaptive mesh refinement.\n35\nDownloaded from the ACM Digital Library on April 13, 2025.\n\nParallel Pattern Language PMAM ’24, March 3, 2024, Edinburgh, United Kingdom\nTo enable the five features defined at the beginning of this section,\na wrapper for pthreads is necessary. This library developed for the\ncode generator supports these five features as follows:\nProgramming model Shared memory parallelism is natively\nsupported by using multiple POSIX threads. The amount used\nis defined in the HWL and corresponds to the number of cores\nspecified, pinning the thread to its corresponding core. Hyper-\nthreading is currently disregarded. The execution units are loosely\ngrouped, by assigning parallel tasklets to the targeted subset of\nthreads.\nIndividual assignments The following two conditions need\nto hold to allow for an assignment of tasklets to individual ex-\necution units. First, a workload or tasklet needs to be definable\nduring compile time. Second, the defined tasklet needs to be assign-\nable to a specific execution unit during compile time. To simplify\nthese conditions and follow the general design of pthreads, a sim-\nple master-worker based thread pool is used, allowing a singular\ndefinition of the threads.\nTo be able to add tasklets with different configurations\ninto the same queue, they are stored as lambda functions\nstd::function<void()> for deferred execution. Due to the pure-\nness of the parallel pattern, all input- and output-arguments can\nbe added into the scope of the lambda function by reference, en-\nsuring identical signatures. Since all data dependencies are known\nbeforehand, data races across lambda functions are avoided via\nsynchronization.\nThe assignment to CPU cores can be performed using the\npthread_setaffinity_np unix kernel callback. This is done by\niterating over all cores and pinning the corresponding to a CPUSET\nonly containing the id of the current core. To ensure MPI progress\nand avoid costly context switches, the main thread is pinned to\nCore 0 by default. This thread handles the integration of all three\nprogramming models and computes sequential workloads. All other\ncores are propagated to the thread pool. Thus Thread 0 will run on\nCore 1. While this reduces the achievable performance slightly, the\ndedicated main thread sped up synchronizations by 3 - 50 times\ndepending on the number of threads, compared to the main thread\nsharing a core with a worker thread. The generated lambda func-\ntions can then be added directly to the task queue of the targeted\ncore, the assignment is being handled by a dedicated main thread,\nwhich also takes care of the integration towards offloading and\ndistributed memory.\nData movement The data transfers are handled by the main\nthread to integrate offloading and distributed memory. Data trans-\nfers on the device are handled by the operating system.\nSynchronization To support synchronization between an arbi-\ntrary set of cores on the CPU, barrier tasklets are employed. Such\nbarrier tasks are possible because task migration is not supported\nand local task queues strictly adhere to a FIFO ordering. The in-\ndividual barrier tasks are added to the queues of the correspond-\ning threads. The pthread_barrier_wait function defined in the\nPOSIX standard only takes the number of threads. Thus, ensuring\nthat the thread fence targets only the required threads, potentially\nincluding the main thread.\nPattern implementation The map and stencil patterns are\nalready decomposed into tasklets without any further dependencies,\nthus they do not require additional work. The reduction pattern\nis further decomposed into a map and reduce step. The map step\nis handled like a map pattern and performs all operations on aprivate copy of the reduction variable. In the reduce step, all threads\nparticipating in shared memory are synchronized and an additional\ntasklet combines all private results in a single value and atomically\nadapts the final output value. The atomic access is used to include\na participating GPU on the same node without risking data races.\nThe integration of distributed memory supports the five features\nas follows:\n4.2 Distributed Memory\nIn the context of distributed memory, many relevant alternatives\nexist, like GASPI [ 1] or OpenSHMEM [ 42]. However, the most ma-\nture and versatile programming model in the context of distributed\nmemory programming is MPI, which was shown capable of imple-\nmenting the OpenSHMEM standard [ 17]. Therefore, MPI is selected\nfor code generation.\nProgramming model By distributing the shared-memory\nthread pool and the accelerator offloading across multiple nodes,\ndistributed memory in a hybrid MPI + X approach is supported.\nIndividual assignments The individual assignments are cov-\nered by assigning the MPI rank in the same order as they are defined\nin the HWL . For example, Rank 0 corresponds to the first node etc.\nData movement The data transfers are explicitly covered by\nMPI communication. Following the potential irregularity gained\nfrom the current optimization approach compared to a rule-based\napproach, the use of other collective communication patterns is not\nyet evaluated. Potential collective communication would need to\nbe addressed via pattern matching, which is known as a feasible\nsolution [19].\nSynchronization The multi-level synchronization allows to first\nsynchronize the main thread and other node local execution units.\nAfterwards, the main threads synchronize via MPI to ensure that all\nrequired data is available before progressing. The synchronization\nbetween main threads is implicitly provided by the blocking MPI\ncommunication.\nPattern implementation Only the reduction pattern requires\nexplicit MPI support, since map and stencil are sufficiently sup-\nported by running distributed with the shared memory or offloading\nprogramming models. For the reduction pattern, the MPI reduction\nis reused in conjunction with the node local reduction\n4.3 Accelerator Offloading\nThe current prototype makes use of CUDA and an adapted thread\npool to simplify addressing multiple GPUs from a single process.\nProgramming model The current prototype explicitly sepa-\nrates the (de-)allocations and data movement from the kernel to\nexploit memory locality across multiple kernels, as intended by\nthe global optimization. The used CUDA calls are wrapped and\ncompiled in a different file to be linked at a later step, avoiding\ncompiler errors with non-CUDA-aware MPI implementations. To\nsimplify targeting specific GPUs, the shared memory thread pool\nprovides a task queue per GPU. By using cudaSetDevice() the\ncorresponding thread is mapped to a specific GPU. The kernels are\nalso generated into the same file as the CUDA calls. The current\nimplementation does not support different parallel patterns to be\nmapped to the same GPU at the same time. Concurrent execution\nof patterns can be realized with asynchronous data transfers and\nCUDA streams but would require additional synchronization.\nData movement The data management is handled by wrapping\nthe functions cudaMalloc ,cudaFree , and cudaMemcpy . Since a\n36\nDownloaded from the ACM Digital Library on April 13, 2025.\n\nPMAM ’24, March 3, 2024, Edinburgh, United Kingdom Schmitz et al.\ndedicated thread takes care of offloading, the data management and\ncomputations can be concurrent with CPU computations.\nSynchronization To ensure the correct ordering of CUDA calls\nonly a single stream is used per GPU. Thus, synchronization is\nonly necessary in case of a data transfer. For data on the GPU\nthat would entail read operations on the output data of the GPU,\nthus cudaMemcpy is sufficient to synchronize the GPU with its\ndedicated thread. To allow a general usage of the GPU data with\nother threads including the main thread, the corresponding shared\nmemory threads in the thread pool need to be synchronized, using\nthe shared memory synchronization.\nPattern implementation For the pattern implementation, the\noptimization decides explicitly how many iterations of the original\npattern are assigned per core, called the execution range. The execu-\ntion range defines the number of iterations each thread needs to per-\nform, with an initial value of ⌊𝑛𝑖𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑠/𝑛𝑡ℎ𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑑⌋. Each thread is identi-\nfied by tid = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x com-\nmonly used in CUDA for work-sharing. The size of a user-defined\npattern is not necessarily evenly divisible by the GPUs warp size.\nTo account for the remainder, the execution range is incremented\nfor the first 𝑛threads, where 𝑛=𝑛𝑖𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑠 %𝑛𝑡ℎ𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑑 . Afterwards, the\nthread loops over all assigned iterations by replicating the original\nINDEX while accounting for the remainder. INDEX =𝑡∗𝑟+𝑖+𝑛,\nwhere𝑡is the thread id, 𝑟the execution range, 𝑖is the current local\niteration, and 𝑛the remainder size, represents the current array\nelement. For the first 𝑛threads, the remainder is covered in the\nexecution range, thus removing the offset of 𝑛again. To avoid ad-\nditional branch divergence, the execution range is always handled\nin the same branch: if (tid < n) .\nThe reduction pattern further requires additional code for the\nintra-block and inter-block reduction. Both of these are already\nsolved problems that could be adopted for the code generator [ 18].\nAs explained in the shared memory section, the access to the reduc-\ntion variable on the CPU is performed atomically to simplifying\na single reduction parallelized across multiple devices on a single\nnode.\n4.4 Prior Optimizations\nTo allow for the generation of parallel code, the optimization has\nto recognize the potential parallelism first. But the optimization\nof parallel patterns needs to strictly adhere to the semantics of\ntheMILP specification of the global optimization. To enable the\noptimization of parallel patterns nested into generic function calls\nor loops of fixed length, inlining and loop unrolling need to be im-\nplemented from within the APT, to allow a proper flattening of the\nhierarchical structure before the optimization. Algorithm 1 shows\nthe general steps of the inlining process within the APT. Given a\nfunction call to be inlined, the tool first queries the corresponding\nfunction declaration and defines a list to store the nodes replacing\nthe original call, here called replacer . To avoid potential scope\noverlaps of variables/parameters sharing the same name, they are\nextended by a hash generated in Line 3. In Lines 4-6, the arguments\nare copied. This enables concurrency between nested parallel pat-\nterns sharing the same data. For input data, only the reference to an\narray is copied to avoid performance degradation. Due to the strict\nread-only policy for function arguments, nested parallel patterns\nmust write to a new local array, avoiding write-after-write and\nwrite-after-read dependencies. To enable the use of return not\nonly as the last statement within a function, the algorithm alsocreates a jump label corresponding to the function call which can\nbe referenced whenever a ReturnNode is encountered (cf. Lines\n7 and 9-11). These jump statements ensure that code that is not\nencountered for specific parameters will not be executed, since it\ncould change the state of the computation. The jump label node is\nalso responsible for deallocating any local data. All other children of\nthe function node are deep copied and references to local variables\nin all child nodes are replaced with the hashed version of the same\nvariable in Lines 12 and 13. In the Lines 16 and 17, the jump label\nis placed and the variable replacing the function call is assigned.\nThecall.replacer variable encapsulates the return values of the\noriginal function and is used to replace the inlined function call in\nexpressions. Since the PPLdefines function calls as individual nodes\nwith an expression, it suffices to set the value of call.replacer\nto an initialized value. During the code generation, the tool can\nthen either print the variable or the original call. The nodes in the\nreplacer list are added as new children before the current call node.\nAlgorithm 1 Simplified APT function inlining.\n1:𝑛𝑜𝑑𝑒←getFunction(call)\n2:𝑟𝑒𝑝𝑙𝑎𝑐𝑒𝑟←[]\n3:𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑙.𝑖𝑛𝑙𝑖𝑛𝑒𝐻𝑎𝑠ℎ←genHash()\n4:for all𝑝𝑎𝑟𝑎𝑚←node.parameters do\n5:𝑟𝑒𝑝𝑙𝑎𝑐𝑒𝑟[]← createCopyAndAssignment(param, call)\n6:end for\n7:𝐽𝑢𝑚𝑝𝐿𝑎𝑏𝑒𝑙←newJumpLabel(call)\n8:for all𝑐ℎ𝑖𝑙𝑑←node.children do\n9: if𝑐ℎ𝑖𝑙𝑑 ==ReturnNode then\n10:𝑟𝑒𝑝𝑙𝑎𝑐𝑒𝑟[]← JmpWithDealloc(JumpLabel, node.scope)\n11: else\n12:𝑐𝑜𝑝𝑦←deepCopy(child)\n13:𝑟𝑒𝑝𝑙𝑎𝑐𝑒𝑟[]← replaceVars(copy, node.scope, call)\n14: end if\n15:end for\n16:𝑟𝑒𝑝𝑙𝑎𝑐𝑒𝑟[]← newJumpLabelNode(JumpLabel)\n17:𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑙.𝑟𝑒𝑝𝑙𝑎𝑐𝑒𝑟←assignLocalResult(node.result)\n18:return replacer\nFor loop unrolling the algorithm can be adapted by repeating\nthe loop in Line 8 𝑁times. To avoid uncertainties in the data\ntransfers, the algorithm should disregard loops containing any\nbreak orcontinue statement. Thus, the management of jump\nlabels/statements can be omitted. Further, parameters and result\nvalues can be omitted as well. Only the loop body needs to be\nincluded𝑁times for a loop with 𝑁iterations including the update\nof the loop variable after every inlined iteration. The loop variable\nmust be initialized with the correct value beforehand. The deep\ncopy and variable replacements work analogously.\n5 Evaluation\nThe optimization and the code generator are the two major influ-\nences for the generated code. To this end, the evaluation is split\ninto two parts. First, the evaluation of the code generator using\nfive examples from prior work [ 47], comparing hand written with\ngenerated code for identical optimizations. Second, an evaluation\nof the full toolchain against the OpenMP version of the Rodinia\nbenchmark suit [ 8], providing a good coverage of the Berkeley\nDwarfs [ 2]. The evaluation setup and its results are detailed in the\nfollowing.\n37\nDownloaded from the ACM Digital Library on April 13, 2025.\n\nParallel Pattern Language PMAM ’24, March 3, 2024, Edinburgh, United Kingdom\nTable 1.

The nodes run Rocky 8.9 as an operating system. For GPU\nresources, the nodes are additionally equipped with two NVIDIA\nV100 GPUs. All codes are compiled with the Intel ®OneAPI C/C++\nCompiler 2022.1.0, IntelMPI 2021.6.0, and CUDA 11.8 using the\nhighest optimization level -O3.\nTo ensure the correctness of the measurements, global optimiza-\ntions are performed without any measurements or artificial synchro-\nnization points since they significantly influence the optimization\nprocess by adding additional dependencies, mitigated utilizing a\nsmaller set of execution units compared to the optimal solution.\nThus, all time measurements are added by hand into the generated\ncode. The average wall-clock times of 40 repetitions are used and\nrepresented in seconds.\nGurobi [ 16] further introduces instabilities into the scheduling\nprocess. As a result, mappings with large differences in the resulting\ncost are encountered for identical inputs. This effect stems from\nthe random seed Gurobi uses to calculate an initial solution. By\nusing multiple seeds, it is possible to mitigate the issue, in this\npaper five random seeds are used. The Rodinia benchmarks show\nno deviations, but two of the generator test cases show strong\ndifferences between Gurobi seeds.\n5.2 Generator Results\nTo evaluate the generated code, three different versions of the same\nparallel code are compared for five different kernels. The kernels\ncontain a batch classification with feature extraction (CPU only), a\njacobi solver for three equation systems (CPU only), a monte -carlo\nestimation of pi (CPU + MPI), a multi -filter convolution for images\n(CPU only), and a neural network forward pass with eight layers\n(GPU). The comparison includes a naive CPU parallelization of the\nkernels as a baseline, a handwritten implementation of the opti-\nmizations applied by the PPL, and a version completely generated\nby the PPLtoolchain. The monte andneural kernels generate un-\nstable results in the MILP optimization, the other three kernels do\nnot indicate such deviations.\nTable 1 presents the measurements for all three versions of the\nfive kernels. The batch kernel shows a slow down of 17% compared\nto the handwritten code and a speedup of 14% compared to the\nbaseline, in case of the multi kernel even speedups of 58% could be\nachieved.

The runtime\nof the 19 Rodinia OpenMP benchmarks is compared to an adapted\nport for the PPLin previous work [ 43]. Both versions are changed\nidentically to fix errors detected by the compiler and add timing\nmeasurements to all benchmarks. The largest provided data set/con-\nfiguration defined by the scripts shipped with Rodinia is used for all\navailable benchmarks. The PPLport is adapted to also fit those sizes.\nSince the Rodinia codes do not show a deviation between different\nseeds the first measurement is used. Both versions are tuned, the\noriginal to the optimal number of cores and the PPLversion auto-\nmatically by the toolchain. Furthermore, the handwritten kernels\nfor the kmeans andnnbenchmarks are optimized to better utilize\nthe parallelism, achieving almost six and 57 times faster runtimes\nin the original Rodinia code. The sources and measurement results\nare added to the auxiliary files accompanying this work3. Table 2\ndepicts the nine Rodinia benchmarks optimized by the PPL, fields\nmarked with \"<-\" show the same optimization and runtime as the\nCPU optimization.\nTen codes from the Rodinia OpenMP version are omitted from\nTable 2 and Figure 1 for five different reasons. The list below states\nwhy and how many codes are implicated for each reason:\nNot supported (3): This class covers the test cases, which are\neither not ported to the PPL(b+tree ,mummerGPU ) or have their\n3https://github.com/RWTH-HPC/PPL/tree/master/Samples/rodinia-ppl\n38\nDownloaded from the ACM Digital Library on April 13, 2025.\n\nPMAM ’24, March 3, 2024, Edinburgh, United Kingdom Schmitz et al.\nbackpropheartwallhotspothotspot3dkmeanslavaMDnnparticlesrad\nSpeedup012345678910111213RodiniaPPLSpeedup\nSpeedupCPU\nSpeedupGPU\nFigure 1.

This limitation is caused\nby the current DSL frontend and the basic dependency analysis.\nDynamic control-flow (2): Benchmarks in this category could\nnot be optimized properly, because their kernel is nested into a\ndynamic control structure ( bfs,streamcluster ), which cannot be\nrepresented by the LP implementation of the mapping algorithm.\nLarge search space (3): These benchmarks ( cfd,nw,pathfinder )\ncan be optimized in theory but the search space is significantly\nlarger than other applications, e.g., the cfdsolver needs to schedule\nat least 64,000 inter-dependent tasklets onto 324 execution units\ncreating a search space too large to be addressed by MILP s in a\nreasonable time.\nDynamic workload (1): The LU-decomposition ( lud) manages\nthe creation of a triangular matrix with branches. This structure\ncannot be analyzed statically at the moment, causing large load im-\nbalances for a static assignment assuming a homogeneous workload\nfor each tasklet.\nMemory overhead (1): The myocyte kernel requires to much\nmemory per thread in the generated code.\nFor the hotspot benchmark, the previously implemented tiling is\nnot possible in the DSL. Thus, the original code is rewritten into\nan element-wise iteration, and the corner cases for the stencil are\nexcluded from their patterns. The static nature of the PPLcombined\nwith the extraction of corner cases avoided almost all branches\nwithin the kernel.\nThe global optimization and especially the scheduling can decide\nto only use a subset of the available hardware if the cost of data\ntransfers and additional synchronization is larger than the benefit\nof additional parallelism. Due to the small sizes of the datasets, the\nPPLdecides to utilize just the CPU resources of a single node for\nmost applications. Only the particle benchmark makes use of GPUs\nif they are available. For multi-node parallelism, the particle and\nbackprop kernels utilize a second node, when it is available.\nDue to the comparable short runtime of many applications they\nmainly benefit from the elimination of synchronization, including\nthebackprop ,hotspot ,kmeans ,nn, and srad benchmarks. This static\nreduction reduction in runtime leads to speedups of 1.20 up to 12.43.\nHotspot3D can at most utilize eight threads due to the current\nparallelization of the array structure, i.e., only the outer most loop,\nwith eight elements, is parallelized. The PPLdoes not enable the\nuse of complex stencil borders, thus extracting them into separatekernels in the PPLversion. Since the original could utilize at most\neight threads, allowing for a parallel execution of edge cases and\nthe main stencil leads to a speedup of 2.72.\nThe original heartwall benchmark is well optimized, leading to\na 0.81 slowdown for the generated code.\nThe lavaMD benchmark shows a speedup of more than two for\nthe code generated by the PPL. This speedup is induced by opti-\nmizations from the Intel ®OneAPI compiler, without optimizations\n(-O0) both versions perform roughly the same with 290 seconds.\n6 Discussion\nThe Rodinia benchmarks highlighted significant benefits of the\napproach in terms of performance. Especially, for smaller applica-\ntions a reduction of static overhead is significant. This is especially\nprevalent with the backprop ,nn, and srad benchmarks. In case of\nthelavaMD benchmark, the PPL could even enable subsequent\ncompilers to apply much more aggressive optimizations reaching\nspeedups of up to 3.5 times, as visualized in Figure 1.\nThe PPL approach shows great potential with its current work-\nflow for static codes, enabling automatic, global optimization for\nheterogeneous architectures from a single source. A single source\nis especially productive for scientific applications that typically\noutlive the clusters they were originally developed for. Instead\nof porting the code to a new cluster, the PPLwould only require\nchanges in the hardware description of the new target system and\npotential tuning of the cache group and tasklet sizes.\nMoreover, the proposed approach of abstracting the parallelism\ninto parallel patterns removes typical boilerplate code, which im-\nproves the programming productivity and maintainability for do-\nmain experts, as shown in previous work [ 43]. In contrast to that,\na significant amount of applications are already written in C/C++\nor Fortran, having to port such applications is a significant effort\nthat many developers will not want to shoulder. Three Rodinia\nbenchmarks are not ported as a result of the limitations introduced\nin the DSL front-end. To address the reusability of source code and\nsimplify the porting process, C/C++ support should be introduced.\nAnnotations similar to OpenMP could be used to identify parallel\npatterns.\nThe code generator is already providing competitive perfor-\nmance for CPU and GPU programming. While a slowdown of 17%\nfor the batch kernel, compared to hand optimized code, is signifi-\ncant. A speedup of 14% compared to the parallel baseline could be\nachieved. However, the jacobi andmonte kernels do not achieve\nspeedups. In case of the jacobi kernel, the relevant optimization\n(kernel fusion) is yet to be implemented. For the monte kernel, the\ncustom reduction implementation, addressing potential shared-,\ndistributed-memory, and offloading at the same time, is not opti-\nmal. Relying on existing shared memory/hybrid implementations\nof a distributed reduction would benefit the runtime, similar to the\napplied GPU reduction.\nCodes with dominant dynamic behavior, e.g., b+tree andbfs, are\nnot well suited for the static approach applied by the PPL, since\nthey would need a way of adapting to different workloads during\nruntime. An extended data dependency analysis could help to iden-\ntify dynamic workloads during compile time. SDFGs [ 4] already\napply a more detailed dependency analysis. SDFGs enable aliasing\nelimination during compile time. Additionally, a dependency chain\n39\nDownloaded from the ACM Digital Library on April 13, 2025.\n\nParallel Pattern Language PMAM ’24, March 3, 2024, Edinburgh, United Kingdom\nfor all remaining variables can be extracted enabling the identifica-\ntion of runtime arguments in control flow structures and parallel\npatterns. To enable this analysis for the PPL, either the dependency\nanalysis needs to be replicated or the a compatibility layer between\nSDFGs and the APT needs to be developed.\nOnce runtime-dependent applications can be identified statically,\nthe code generation can be addressed accordingly. The dynamic\nsolution needs to be able to react to different levels of uncertainty\nsince not only the cost of a single pattern but also the number of\npatterns might be dynamic. Legion [ 3] would enable the execution\nof patterns/tasklets of unknown size but dynamic load-imbalances\nbetween patterns cannot be addressed. StarPU [ 14] additionally\nenable the migration of tasklets in distributed memory during\nruntime. Both StarPU and Legion enable the use of GPUs. Thus,\ngenerating code for StarPU would be the most feasible approach to\nsupport dynamic applications at the moment.\nThree Rodinia benchmarks that could not be optimized in over\n24 hours because of their exponentially growing search space. As a\nresult, scalability of the tasklet scheduling is not feasible. A change\nin variable names, which are influenced by the random seed, can\nhave a drastic effect on the duration of the solving process [ 26].\nIt is not reasonable for the user to find a good random seed. An\nalternative to LP-solvers would be a custom implementation of\nbeam search to create more predictable duration for the scheduling\nand also eliminate the risk of unstable solutions. Beam search\nhas been applied successfully to scheduling problems for a long\ntime[ 40]. Applying beam search entails the implementation of\npruning strategies required to limit the search space. The pruning\nstrategies, e.g., n-best, provide means of controlling the compile-\ntime while providing a stable and reproducible result. The work\nof Birgin et al. [ 6] applies beam search on a machine scheduling\nproblem of consecutive production steps in a manufacturing process\nwith multiple machines and products. Their approach is similar to\nthe scheduling problem encountered during the global optimization,\nwith one key difference, requiring a corresponding adaption. The\ndistance between machines is not yet considered but can be added\nas a function depending on the source, destination, and amount of\ndata, all of which is available during the optimization. The use of a\nmore stable solving process further allows a potential integration\nof parallelism within dynamic control flow structures, such as loops\nand branches. This avoids the additional load of unrolling large\nloops and enables the parallelization of additional applications,\nincluding streamcluster andcfd.\nThe memory model of the code generator should also be im-\nproved to avoid local memory copies, impacting both the particle\nandmyocyte . For normal functions, pureness is not a strict require-\nment and avoiding copies is therefore not trivial. A new global\noptimization step to eliminate local copies could be introduced.\nDepending on the size of the data and potential parallelism, the\noptimization could decide whether a local copy or an access by\nreference would be more beneficial.\nTo analyze the PPLtoolchain on a larger application a port of the\nLULESH mini-app is available4. LULESH [ 21] is a physical simula-\ntion proxy application for a three dimensional wave propagation.\nThe code is designed for weak scaling and is originally implemented\nas a hybrid MPI+OpenMP application. The code utilizes iterative\nsolvers as an approximation for the underlying physics as well\n4https://github.com/RWTH-HPC/PPL/tree/master/Samples/lulesh-pplas an iteration over time steps for the entire wave propagation.\nWhile the LULESH port runs and the time stepping could be un-\nrolled for a fixed number the iterative stencil kernels containing\nthe propagation logic make up about 60% of the sequential runtime.\nSince the nested patterns would also require parallelism LULESH\nonly highlights the same issues regarding dynamic structures al-\nready identified using Rodinia. While the LULESH port shows that\nthePPLcan represent larger applications a detailed analysis of a\nlarger application provides only a small benefit for the development\nwhile smaller less complicated applications already show the same\ndynamic behavior.\nThe global optimization approach is applicable to parallel pro-\ngrams in general, as indicated by the port of Rodinia in previous\nwork [ 43]. Parallel patterns are used to reduce the analysis com-\nplexity. By adapting the analysis and view global optimizations\ncould also be implemented for other parallel programming models\nlike OpenMP.\n7 Conclusion and Future Work\nThe implementation of the code generator enables the use of global\noptimizations [ 32,47] and the intermediate representation [ 43].\nThe combined prototype provides a toolchain to automatically op-\ntimize and assign workloads to heterogeneous architectures based\non a single, high-level source code. This significantly improves the\ndeveloper’s productivity and code maintainability, while targeting\nperformance portability. The proposed prototype can compile and\nrun most of the Rodinia benchmarks on cluster systems involving\nshared memory, distributed memory, and GPU offloading. By elimi-\nnating static overhead and utilizing additional parallelism, speedups\nof up to 12.43 could be achieved compared to the already parallel\nRodinia benchmarks. The optimization prototype even revealed\nadditional concurrency in the kmeans andhotspot3D benchmark\nresulting in speedups of 1.20 and 2.72 compared to the original\nOpenMP version.\nIn future work, the following limitations will be addressed. First,\nthe code generator will be further improved to better utilize MPI. Es-\npecially the reduction implementation should rely more on existing\nsolution to improve efficiency. Second, the memory overhead needs\nto be reduced by avoid/removing local copies. Next, the scalability\nof the scheduling step will be addressed by evaluating custom prun-\ning strategies and scheduling algorithms like beam search. Support\nfor C/C++ will be added to reduce the porting effort for applica-\ntions and testing. Finally, dynamic applications could be addressed\nby extending the code generation towards existing dynamic load\nbalancers.\nReferences\n[1]Thomas Alrutz, Jan Backhaus, Thomas Brandes, Vanessa End, Thomas Gerhold,\nAlfred Geiger, Daniel Grünewald, Vincent Heuveline, Jens Jägersküpper, Andreas\nKnüpfer, et al .2013.

It has received praise for the\nhigh-quality results in several natural language processing\n(NLP) tasks [ 20] due in part to the unprecedented investment\n($12 million USD) and size of its training model (175 billion\nparameters at 800 GB). Hence GPT-3 and its successor GPT-42\nare defining several societal questions for the near future.\nAs we enter the exascale computing era, which is dom-\ninated by the extreme heterogeneity of hardware and pro-\ngramming models [ 46], AI-assisted code generation could\nplay a key role in how we develop, deploy, and test soft-\nware that targets high-performance computing (HPC) sys-\ntems. Traditional human-readable code such as C ++[42],\nFortran [ 2], Python [ 45], and more recently Julia [ 4], are a\nstraightforward application for GPT-3 LLM capabilities that\nwould help redefine software development. Hence, we need\nto understand the current state of practice, limitations, and\npotential of this new technology.\nOur early experiences with OpenAI Codex, which is a GPT-\n3 descendant, came from using the GitHub Copilot3plugin\n1https://openai.com/\n2https://openai.com/product/gpt-4\n3https://github.com/features/copilotarXiv:2306.15121v1  [cs.AI]  27 Jun 2023\navailable on Visual Studio Code4to generate relevant scien-\ntific kernels for HPC. Our goal is to assess and understand\nthe impact of GPT-3’s state-of-art capabilities in the over-\nall interactive process for generating, optimizing, building,\nand testing well-established mathematical HPC kernels. For\nour assessment, we evaluate AXPY, general matrix-vector\nmultiply (GEMV), general matrix-matrix multiply (GEMM),\nsparse matrix–vector multiplication (SpMV), 3D Jacobi sten-\ncil computations, and conjugate gradients (CG). We test the\ngeneration of these kernels over a variety of programming\nmodels that target CPU and GPU hardware. Our goal is to\nestablish a benchmark and understand the status of prompt\nengineering in the OpenAI Codex when applied to these im-\nportant kernels and programming models as the technology\ncontinues to evolve.\nThe rest of the paper is structured as follows: Section 2\nprovides an overview of related efforts that highlight the\nrecent attention to these topics in the broader area of com-\nputer science. We describe our prompt input pattern method-\nology for interacting with GitHub Copilot for the kernel\ngeneration process along with the proposed metric to score\nthe quality of the suggested outputs in Section 3. Section 4\npresents the results of our evaluation along with our find-\nings on prompt trade-off options for each language, kernel,\nprogramming model, and additional keyword inputs on the\ngenerated outputs. We aim to understand the current sta-\ntus of the correctness, trade-offs, and overall value of LLMs\nfor HPC practitioners who wish to adopt this technology.\nConclusions and future directions are presented in Section 5.\nAppendix A provides the artifact description for the repro-\nducibility of this study.\n2 BACKGROUND\nThe availability of GPT-3 has led to increasing interest in its\nLLM capabilities and how they could be applied to a large\nvariety of applications. Brown et al. [ 6] introduced the semi-\nnal paper on GPT-3’s unprecedented results, which showed\nstrong performance in NLP interactions such as translation,\nquestion-answering, and cloze tasks. They highlight the use\nand success rates of prompt-based [ 14,15] zero, one, and\nfew-shot learning (FSL) techniques when only a few data\nexamples are available to train a model as opposed to other\npreviously trained ML alternatives. Wang et al. [ 47] pre-\nsented a comprehensive review of FSL and pointed out the\n“unreliable empirical risk minimizer” that, due to its nature,\ncompensates for the lack of supervised information by using\nprior available knowledge. Floridi and Chiriatti [ 17] provide\na commentary on the nature of GPT-3, its scope, and limits\n4https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/getting-started-with-github-\ncopilot?tool=vscodewhile outlining the social consequences of the “industrial-\nization of automatic cheap production of good, semantic\nartifacts.”\nOn the code generation side, Dehaerne et al. [ 10] provided\na systematic review of applying ML methods in description-\nto-code, code-to-code, and code-to-description studies from\nthe past 6 years. The review indicated limitations, including\nthe variability in the quality of generated, mined source code\nand the need and availability of large datasets (e.g., GitHub\nsources). The review also highlighted that automatically gen-\nerating data is a fast alternative for obtaining data but is\nonly appropriate for certain contexts, such as programming\nby example . Recent work has also focused on using GitHub\nCopilot’s AI pair programmer , which is based on OpenAI\nCodex and leverages the vast stores of source code hosted\non GitHub for AI-assisted code generation. Chen et al. [ 8]\nprovided an introduction and evaluation of Codex for its\nPython code-writing capabilities. They point out the current\nlimitations and difficulty with “docstrings describing long\nchains of operations and with binding operations to vari-\nables.” A major challenge noted is the overreliance on Codex\nby novice programmers. Importantly, Copilot uses a differ-\nent Codex version than the one used in our study. Nguyen\nand Nadi [ 31] provided an empirical evaluation of GitHub\nCopilot suggestions for correctness and understandability\nto LeetCode questions in Java, JavaScript, Python, and C.\nShortcomings included generating further simplified code\nthat relies on undefined functions. Vaithilingam, Zhang, and\nGlassman [ 43] provided a human subject study that consisted\nof 24 participants on the usability of GitHub Copilot. They\nconcluded that Copilot did not necessarily reduce the task\ncompletion time in common tasks, such as file editing, web\nscraping, and graph plotting, for experienced Python users.\nSobania et al. [ 41] found little difference between Copilot and\nautomatic generators that use genetic programming when\napplied to the PSB2 program synthesis benchmarks [ 19].\nImai [ 21] provided a preliminary assessment that showed\nthat, although Copilot helps generate lines of code faster, the\nquality is lower when compared to human pair programming.\nYetistiren et al. [ 49] assessed the correctness, validity, and\nefficiency of targeting the HumanEval problem dataset [ 8]\nwith a high success rate.\nFrom an educational perspective, Sarsa et al. [ 40] discussed\nCodex’s effectiveness in generating programming exercises\nand explanations via Copilot, not without addressing the\nneed for oversight in output quality. Finnie-Ansley et al. [ 16]\nreported that Codex ranks high when compared to a class\nof introductory computer science students taking program-\nming tests. Similarly, Denny et al. [ 11] discussed the ped-\nagogical value of Copilot for testing their answers and for\nits prompt nature in introductory programming questions.\nWermelinger [ 48] discussed important questions about how\nteaching programming will evolve. Similarly, Brennan and\nLesage [ 5] discussed the educational opportunities for un-\ndergraduate engineering and the need for students to have a\nstrong intuition for software development when using AI-\nassisted tools.\nPierce et al. [ 37] assessed security aspects of Copilot’s code\ncontributions in a large sample, and they found relatively\nhigh vulnerability rates. They also concluded that there is\na need to quantify the limits of generated code in low-level\nscenarios, and Copilot must be paired with security-aware\ntooling.\nOverall, there is a common thread in the relevant literature:\nthe GPT-based tools are here to stay and will impact almost\nevery aspect of human-computer interaction. However, we\nare at an inflection point where more exploratory research\nis needed when assessing AI code-generating capabilities,\nand their technical, economic, and social implications must\nbe carefully explored and better understood. To the best of\nour knowledge there is no reported work on the application\nof current Copilot capabilities for HPC kernels.\n3 METHODOLOGY\nWe evaluate prompt outputs for parallel programming mod-\nels available in four different languages: C ++, Fortran, Python,\nand Julia. Our methodology has two aspects: (1) the Copilot\ncode suggestion generation from prompt queries based on\nkernels and the parallel programming model for each lan-\nguage and (2) a simple metric to evaluate the correctness\nof the results. As stated in their documentation,5GitHub\nCopilot is “trained on all languages that appear in public\nrepositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions\nyou receive may depend on the volume and diversity of train-\ning data for that language.” Hence, we investigate whether\nor not these results correlate with the expected availability\nof correct programming models and public code examples.\nWe will use assess popularity, in particular for open-source\nsoftware [ 30], based on (1) the number of repositories per\nlanguage on GitHub (GitHut6) and (2) the TIOBE index.7\nHence, C ++and Python codes are expected to have wider\navailability than Julia and Fortran. Nevertheless, because of\nthe general-purpose nature of C ++and Python, this metric\nmight not be as relevant as it is for scientific and mathemati-\ncal applications written in Fortran or Julia.\nWe assess the outputs from each prompt and categorize\nbased on their level of correctness. The rest of the section\ndescribes the experiment setup and the proposed metric to\nquantify the quality of the AI-generated results.\n5https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/overview-of-github-copilot/about-\ngithub-copilot-for-individuals\n6https://madnight.github.io/githut/#/pull_requests/2023/1\n7https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/3.1 Experiment setup\nWe select a simple prompt base structure for each targeted\nlanguage. Visual Studio Code recognizes the targeted lan-\nguage through the appropriate support plugin and the cur-\nrently opened file based on the language extension (e.g., cpp,\nf90, py, jl) and makes it part of the prompt prefix. The rest\nof the prompt is generated through a comment line comple-\nmented with optional code. Pressing <Control> + <Enter>\nresults in a separate window that contains a maximum of 10\ncode suggestions. Given the highly sensitive nature of the\nLLM, even one additional keyword could heavily influence\nthe output.\n(a)\n(b)\nFigure 1: GitHub Copilot prompt interface with op-\ntional language keywords for (a) Fortran’s subroutine\nand (b) Python’s def.\nTherefore, our simple prompt queries can be described by\nusing the following structure:\n•<kernel> <programming-model>\n•<kernel> <programming-model> <optional keywords:\nfunction ,subroutine , and def>\nTable 1 shows the programming language and model com-\nbinations used for this study. The additional post-fix optional\nkeywords correspond to our attempt to add more information\nto the prompt query to obtain better-quality suggestions. As\nshown in Section 4, C ++model sensitivity can vary by using\nthe word function (not a language keyword), whereas For-\ntran and Python are consistently sensitive to the subroutine\nanddefkeywords. We also found little sensitivity in Julia\nprompts when adding a post fix (e.g., function ), hence we\ndid not add it in this study.\nLanguage Programming model Post fix\nC++ OpenMP [36] offload, function\nOpenACC [35] function\nKokkos [7] function\nCUDA [33] function\nHIP [1] function\nThrust [34] function\nFortran OpenMP offload, subroutine\nOpenACC subroutine\nPython numpy [44] def\nNumba [29] def\npyCUDA [26] def\ncuPy [32] def\nJulia Threads [27]\nCUDA [3]\nAMDGPU [39]\nKernelAbstractions [9]\nTable 1: Scope of our experimental setup applied for\neach kernel in terms of language and targeted parallel\nprogramming model.\n3.2 Correctness metric\nTo evaluate the correctness of the generated suggestions,\nwe propose a simple approach that is based on our observa-\ntions more than on any particular formalism. We consider\nfive levels of correctness and proficiency labels between [0],\nornon-knowledge , and [1], or expert , when observing the\nsuggested answers given by Copilot as those illustrated in\nFigures 1a and 1b for each combination in Table 1.\n0non-knowledge : No code at all or not a single correct\ncode.\n0.25 novice : One correct code, but it includes other several\ncorrect or incorrect programming models (e.g., Ope-\nnACC suggestions in an OpenMP prompt).\n0.5learner : One correct code, and there are other incorrect\ncodes, but all of them are using the requested program-\nming model.\n0.75 proficient : All codes are correct and using the program-\nming model requested.\n1expert : Only one piece of code is provided, and it is\ntotally correct.4 RESULTS\nWe present our analysis for each selected language and ker-\nnel and discuss some observations from our initial interaction\nwith GitHub Copilot. As shown in Figures 1a and 1b, for each\ncombination listed in Table1, we obtain a set of suggestions\nfor each prompt. This approach enables us to evaluate the\neffectiveness of OpenAI Codex in generating accurate and\nproficient code. Notably, none of the experiments reached a\nperfect score of 1, which illustrates the stochastic status of\nthe current LLM when applied to a particular area.\n4.1 C++\nTable 2 shows the results for all of our C ++experiments,\nand Figure 2 illustrates the results according to the different\nkernels and programming models.\nPrompt AXPY GEMV GEMM SpMV Jacobi CG\nPrefix <kernel>\nOpenMP 0.75 0.5 0.5 0.5 0 0.25\nOpenMP offload 0.5 0.5 0.5 0.25 0.25 0\nOpenACC 0.5 0 0.25 0 0 0\nKokkos 0.5 0 0 0 0.25 0\nCUDA 0.75 0.75 0.75 0 0 0.25\nHIP 0.75 0 0 0 0.25 0\nThrust 0.25 0 0 0 0 0\nSyCL 0.75 0.25 0 0 0 0\nPrefix <kernel>\nPost fix function\nOpenMP 0.75 0.75 0.75 0.25 0.25 0.25\nOpenMP offload 0.5 0.5 0.5 0.25 0.25 0\nOpenACC 0.5 0.5 0.5 0.25 0 0\nKokkos 0.75 0.25 0.25 0 0.25 0\nCUDA 0.75 0.25 0 0 0 0\nHIP 0.75 0 0 0 0.25 0\nThrust 0.5 0 0.25 0 0 0\nSyCL 0.75 0.5 0.25 0 0 0\nTable 2: Metric assessment for GitHub Copilot’s C ++\noutputs using the input prompt pattern <kernel>\n<programming model> (function) .\nAs shown, the best results are achieved for the AXPY ker-\nnel. We see a clear trend in these results (Figure 2 [left]): the\nmore complex the kernel, the fewer quality results are ob-\ntained. Although we see a level between learner andproficient\nfor the AXPY kernel (the simplest kernel), for CG (the most\ncomplicated kernel), the level is close to non-knowledge . For\nthe programming models, we see better results for OpenMP\nand CUDA. This could be due to the maturity of these pro-\ngramming models compared to others and their availability\nin public code. We note that the use of function as part\nFigure 2: Results for C++ kernels (top) and program-\nming models (bottom).\nof the prompt is very beneficial and increments the qual-\nity of the results in the dense matrix cases. Sparse matrices\nand high-level algorithms (e.g., SpMV, Jacobi, and CG) do\nnot show much improvement. However, a different trend\nis observed for CUDA, for which, instead of improving the\nlevel of proficiency, it actually decreases the quality of the\nanswer. This is perhaps because the word function is not\nused for CUDA codes. In our experimentation, which is not\nshown here, using the words “kernel” or “ __global__ ” led\nto better code generation quality. This is an example of how\nimportant it is to adapt the language used for the prompts\nto the particularities or syntax habitually used by such a\ncommunity.\nResults also show that high-level programming model\nprompts from Kokkos, Thrust, and SyCL perform poorly over\nseveral kernels. We view these results as a reflection of the\nuser community size of these high-level abstractions. Over\nseveral instances, we observed that many wrong answersor no answers at all dominate as the kernel becomes more\ncomplex. Notably, large benchmark repositories are available\n(e.g., HecBench [ 22,23]), from which some of the responses\noriginate.\n4.2 Fortran\nFortran is of particular interest in this analysis owing to its\nimportance in HPC and scientific computing. Despite not\nbeing a mainstream language in terms of code availability,\nCopilot can provide some good results because of Fortran’s\ndomain-specific nature and legacy.\nAs shown in Table 3, using an “optimized” prompt and\nthesubroutine keyword is particularly beneficial in this\ncase. Not using it leads to very poor results, with the AXPY\nOpenMP case being the only exception due to its simplicity\nand availability. We observe a trend similar to the one we saw\nin the C ++case: the more mature solutions such as OpenMP\nand OpenACC provide better results for parallel codes that\nuse Fortran.\nPrompt AXPY GEMV GEMM SpMV Jacobi CG\nPrefix <kernel>\nOpenMP 0.75 0 0 0 0 0\nOpenMP offload 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOpenACC 0 0 0 0 0 0\nPrefix <kernel>\nPost fix subroutine\nOpenMP 0.75 0.25 0.25 0.5 0.5 0.25\nOpenMP offload 0.25 0.25 0.25 0.25 0.5 0.25\nOpenACC 0.25 0.25 0.25 0.25 0.25 0.25\nTable 3: Metric assessment for Copilot’s outputs us-\ning the input prompt pattern <kernel> <programming\nmodel> (subroutine) for Fortran.\nFigure 3 illustrates the uniform characteristics in the re-\nsponses across kernels. Fortran is used in many legacy HPC\napplications, and with so many available Fortran codes to\ndraw from, it is not surprising that Copilot can obtain cor-\nrect kernel implementations with higher complexity kernels\n(e.g., CG, Jacobi) in addition to the simpler ones (e.g., AXPY,\nGEMM).\n4.3 Python\nPython is one of the most-used, general-purpose languages\nin industry, research, and AI and also has an important role\nin education and as a major target of AI-generative code, as\ndocumented in Section 2. Although neither a parallel pro-\ngramming model nor part of the standard, we consider numpy\nin our evaluation because it is the de-facto standard for sci-\nentific computing in Python.\nFigure 3: Results for Fortran kernels (top) and program-\nming models (bottom).\nTable 4 shows the results from our evaluation. Similar to\nFortran, we observe that the quality improves dramatically\nwhen adding the Python defkeyword to clarify that we\nare looking for functions in the language. Overall, Copilot\ncan generate acceptable numpy, cuPy, and pyCUDA imple-\nmentations across several kernels, but Numba falls behind.\nPerhaps this is an indication that cuPy and pyCUDA are\nmore popular alternatives in the community via lightweight\nlayers on top of compiled C or CUDA code, rather than using\nNumba’s just-in-time approach on top of LLVM. Notably,\nNumba recently deprecated support for AMD GPU hard-\nware, hence reinforcing the idea that GPU kernels written\nin Python favor CUDA-like implementations. Interestingly,\nsuccessful GPU instances (e.g., pyCUDA and cuPy) include\na correct raw CUDA kernel source code as a user-defined\nkernel. These instances are described in pyCUDA [ 25] and\ncuPy [38] documentation, respectively.Prompt AXPY GEMV GEMM SpMV Jacobi CG\nPrefix <kernel>\nnumpy 0.25 0 0 0 0 0\nCuPy 0 0 0.25 0 0 0\npyCUDA 0 0 0 0 0 0\nNumba 0 0 0 0 0 0\nPrefix <kernel>\nPost fix def\nnumpy 0.75 0.25 0.25 0.5 0.5 0.75\nCuPy 0.5 0.25 0.25 0.25 0.25 0.25\npyCUDA 0.5 0.25 0.5 0.5 0.25 0\nNumba 0.25 0 0 0 0 0\nTable 4: Metric assessment for Copilot’s outputs us-\ning the input prompt pattern <kernel> <programming\nmodel> (def) for Python.\nAs seen in Figure 4, the resulting kernels can have vary-\ning degrees of success, but most return at least one correct\nanswer. This is perhaps attributed to the wide availability\nof Python and numpy code in public repositories. The trend\nalso confirms the lack of correct Numba results, and perhaps\nit is an opportunity to exploit its pure-Python nature. Al-\nthough, as recently highlighted by Kailasa et al. [ 24], writing\nNumba code for complex algorithms can be as challenging\nas using a compiled language.\n4.4 Julia\nWe included the Julia language in our experiments because of\nits mathematical and performance focus. Julia provides an in-\nteresting proposition for building a dynamic language on top\nof LLVM and is heavily influenced by Fortran in its syntax\nfor targeting scientific computing problems. Julia provides\nan accessible programming model for CPU Threads, which\nis part of the base language, for vendor-specific CUDA.jl\nand AMDGPU.jl, and for KernelAbstraction.jl for portable\nkernels across vendors. In previous work [ 18], we showed\npromising results, albeit with some gaps, in a simple perfor-\nmance comparison on CPU and GPU runs.\nTable 5 and Figure 5 show the results for each kernel and\nprogramming model in our evaluation. For each program-\nming model, we see a proficiency level between novice and\nlearner for Threads (part of the base language) and CUDA.jl,\nwhich are the most used and mature programming models.\nAMDGPU.jl and KernelAbstractions.jl rank lower, which cor-\nrelates with their novelty and the more limited availability\nof example code that targets non-NVIDIA GPU hardware.\nLike with C ++, a more complex kernel led to fewer cor-\nrect results. For example, we could not get an appropriate\nFigure 4: Results for Python kernels (top) and program-\nming models (bottom).\nimplementation for the CG kernel (a multikernel algorithm).\nUnsurprisingly, as in the case of Fortran, Julia’s mathemat-\nical nature allowed the OpenAI Codex to find and suggest\nappropriate solutions in other kernels, despite Julia being a\nrelatively new language with fewer publicly available codes,\nespecially compared to C ++and Python. Notably, our results\ndid not necessarily improve by adding more information\nto the prompt (e.g., the function language keyword). This\ncould be an advantage for domain-specific syntax, as in the\ncase of Fortran, because most existing codes have a very\ntargeted use with fewer words.\n4.5 Discussion\nTo gain insight into the performance of OpenAI Codex across\ndifferent languages and kernels, we collated the results in\nFigure 6. As depicted in the graph, the complexity of the\nkernel directly impacts the quality of the results obtained. In\nother words, it becomes increasingly challenging to achieve\nacceptable results as the kernel’s complexity increases.Prompt AXPY GEMV GEMM SpMV Jacobi CG\nPrefix <kernel>\nThreads 0.75 0.25 0.5 0 0 0\nCUDA 0.75 0.5 0.5 0.25 0.25 0\nAMDGPU 0 0 0 0.25 0 0\nKernelAbstractions 0.25 0.25 0.25 0.25 0.25 0\nTable 5: Metric assessment for Copilot’s outputs us-\ning the input prompt pattern <kernel> <programming\nmodel> for Julia.\nFigure 5: Results for Julia kernels (top) and program-\nming models (bottom).\nWe see a relatively low level of proficiency in OpenAI\nCodex with an average of novice level for the languages\nand kernels tested. We see a slightly higher quality for the\nmore popular C ++and Python languages than for Julia or\nFortran. This may be related to the popularity, maturity, and\naccessibility of public codes implemented in those languages.\nFigure 6: Overall results for Copilot kernels (top) and\nprogramming languages (bottom).\nHowever, Fortran and Julia provide very acceptable results.\nThe results confirm that the question is more about targeted\nquality than quantity in a specific domain.\nWe summarize our results as follows:\n•As code complexity increases, obtaining acceptable\nresults becomes more challenging.\n•Generating high-quality multistep or multikernel codes\n(e.g., CG) can be difficult.\n•Using keywords can improve the proficiency of the\nanswers, but it is essential to choose the correct words\nthat are specific and sensitive to each programming\nlanguage/model or community.\n•Although the popularity or accessibility of a program-\nming language or public code can be important, less\npopular languages can also provide good results owing\nto their targeted nature.5 CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE\nDIRECTIONS\nWe carried out an initial study to evaluate the current ca-\npacity of OpenAI Codex via Copilot for the generation of\nHPC numerical kernels that target parallel programming\nmodels in C ++, Fortran, Python, and Julia. Despite current\nlimitations, we believe that generative AI can have an extraor-\ndinary and beneficial impact on HPC software development,\nmaintenance, and education in the future.\nThe research community still has several gaps to under-\nstand, and one such gap is the need for a more comprehensive\ntaxonomy, akin to natural language, to evaluate accuracy\nand trustworthiness. Although our proposed taxonomy was\nbeneficial for this initial study, it is imperative that such met-\nrics be expanded to create a widely accepted methodology\nthat the entire community can use. Therefore, a standard and\nrecognized approach is needed to ensure uniformity when\nevaluating results across studies.\nThe emergence of LLM technologies such as GPT-3 and\nother generative AI tools presents significant questions about\ntheir integration into the future HPC software development\necosystem. For instance, can a human-in-the-loop and com-\npiler be incorporated to refine initial LLM suggestions? Can\nmetadata-rich suggestions be incorporated to facilitate a\nhuman decision-making process? Additionally, how do sig-\nnificant HPC software modernization initiatives similar to\nDARPA’s High Productivity Computing Systems [ 12] or the\nUS Department of Energy’s Exascale Computing Project\n[13, 28] incorporate these novel tools?\nThe automation of ecosystem features, such as building\nsystems, packaging, validation & verification, reproducibility,\nand continuous integration/continuous deployment pipelines,\ncould significantly impact the HPC community. The tech-\nnologies that put today’s imperfect information closer to the\nhuman in question could redefine the educational aspects of\nHPC. Therefore, it is crucial to understand how each commu-\nnity can leverage these revolutionary capabilities to further\nadvance their respective domains.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThis work is funded by Bluestone, an X-Stack project in the\nDOE Advanced Scientific Computing Office with program\nmanager Hal Finkel.\nREFERENCES\n[1]AMD. 2022.

Domain Specialization as the Key to Make Large\nLanguage Models Disruptive: A Comprehensive Survey. 1, 1 (April 2024), 35 pages. https://doi.org/10.1145/nnnnnnn.nnnnnnn\n1 INTRODUCTION\nThe evolution of natural language processing (NLP) and artificial intelligence (AI) models has witnessed a remarkable\ntrajectory, beginning with the rule-based systems of the 1950s and 1960s, transitioning to statistical models in the 1990s,\nfollowed by the emergence of neural networks in the 2010s. Owing to the success of self-attention and Transformer-\nbased neural network architecture [ 152], Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) emerged and swiftly gained popularity\nin the late 2010s due to their ability to learn universal language representations from large-scale data in an unsupervised\nmanner, which can be beneficial for many downstream NLP tasks such as commonsense reasoning [ 173], multiple-choice\nquestion answering [ 131], and story generation [ 13], while avoiding training new models from scratch. In the last few\nyears, with the fast growth of large corpus and hardware capacities, researchers have found scaling up model and\ntraining data can continuously improve the model capacity, following the scaling law [ 65], eventually resulting in Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) [ 166], such as GPT-3 [ 11] (175B parameters), PaLM [ 20] (540B parameters), and LLaMA [ 149]\n(65B parameters). LLMs, significantly outperforming smaller models in understanding and generating human-like text,\nhave emerged as a promising AI research trend. Their potential to revolutionize natural and social sciences through\nefficient literature analysis, novel hypothesis generation, and complex data interpretation could accelerate research,\nenhance the discovery process, and facilitate interdisciplinary collaboration.\nWhile LLMs hold great promise as general task solvers, effectively extending their functionality beyond mere “chatbot”\nroles poses significant challenges. This has led to the emergence of “domain specialization of LLMs”. Specifically, domain\nspecialization of Large Language Models (LLMs) is defined as the process of customizing general-purpose LLMs according\nto specific domain contextual data, augmented by domain-specific knowledge, optimized by the domain’s objective, and\nregulated by domain-specific constraints. This shift towards domain specialization of LLMs is motivated by several\ncompelling reasons. First, there are significant differences in conversation and language styles in different fields,\nroles, and tasks ranging from medical prescriptions to legal sentences, to online chatting, etc. The acquisition of\nsuch capabilities and experience even require human beings many years of training, a lot of which are hands-on and\nproprietary. Moreover, different fields, institutions, and teams have their own “business models” about which response\nwill maximize their own utility function for their tasks, which is not directly replaceable by a single general-purpose\nLLMs solver with no customization. More importantly, the requirement of domain knowledge for professional-level\nManuscript submitted to ACM\nDomain Specialization as the Key to Make Large Language Models Disruptive: A Comprehensive Survey 3\nusage also need to be very in-depth, in-real-time, and accurate, none of which can be easily achieved by pre-trained\nLLMs. Many domain knowledge resources are proprietary assets and core competitiveness of the organizations that can\nnever be leaked to general-purpose LLMs. Last but not the least, languages are constrained by social norms, cultural\nconformity, religious beliefs, legal requirements, and ethical practice, all of which are changing parameters in different\nlocations, countries, populations, races, communities, etc., which make general-purpose LLMs impossible to be a\none-fits-all solver without any customization.\nDomain Specialization of LLMs is a critical yet challenging problem that requires inventing and integrating effective\ntechniques to address the serious challenges. Particularly, there are three significant challenges.\nChallenge 1: Difficulty keeping an LLM updated with the latest knowledge. The power of LLMs is attributed\nmainly to their massive training corpus. Yet, it also indicates LLMs tend to have a knowledge cut-off and lack sufficient\naccess to the latest information, events, or discoveries. In many specialized domains, new discoveries, regulations,\nand best practices continuously emerge, making it difficult for LLMs to stay up-to-date. For instance, more than 30\nthousand mainstream news articles are published every day [ 157]. For social media analysis and fact-checking, LLMs\nmay not handle them since the knowledge extracted from the training corpus is offline. This indicates that regular\nre-training or continuous learning mechanisms are required to maintain LLMs’ relevance and accuracy in these dynamic\nfields. However, ensuring the model freshness can be resource-intensive, as it necessitates continuous high-quality and\nup-to-date data collection, processing, and computationally intensive model re-training.\nChallenge 2: Difficulty in learning all specialized knowledge of different domains in one LLM. LLMs, by\ndefault, possess general knowledge across a wide range of topics and may have seen and obtained specific knowledge for\nmost domains. However, more popular or widely-discussed topics may be over-represented, while very domain-specific\ntopics can usually be under-represented, which makes it difficult to be effectively learned for domain-specific tasks. In\naddition, domain-specific tasks often involve complex concepts, specialized terminology, and intricate relationships\nbetween entities. Without proper guidance, LLMs may generate plausible-sounding but inconsistent answers to similar\nqueries (i.e., LLM’s hallucination) or slightly rephrased questions [ 5]. This issue arises because LLMs are designed to\npredict the most likely word sequences based on the input rather than providing a definitive answer based on a structured\nknowledge base. Researchers have found users can guide the model to produce more relevant, accurate, and task-specific\nresponses, enhancing the overall utility and effectiveness of AI systems across numerous domains by providing LLMs\nwith a few task-specific demonstrations [ 166]. Nevertheless, providing LLMs with adequate demonstrations is not trivial\nsince user instructions can often be vague, incomplete, or ambiguous, making it difficult to discern the intended meaning\nor desired outcome. Let alone LLMs tend to have a finite context window, typically determined by the maximum token\nlength they can process (e.g., ChatGPT can only handle 4097 tokens).\nChallenge 3: Intensive model and computational complexity required for downstream task learning. To\nbetter adapt to specific domain applications, downstream task learning is historically a commonly used practice to\nspecialize language models. However, different from traditional language models, adapting an LLM to downstream tasks\nneeds vast amounts of high-quality, task-specific data. Acquiring, cleaning, and pre-processing such data can be time-\nconsuming and resource-intensive. Moreover, the sheer complexity of LLMs makes it challenging to identify the most\nappropriate down-stream task learning strategy, as the choice of hyperparameters, learning rate, and training duration\ncan significantly impact the model’s performance. Chen et al. [ 16] have also discussed down-stream task learning for\nLLMs may lead to severe catastrophic forgetting since the LLM with a complex architecture is more likely to forget\npreviously learned knowledge and overfits to target domains. In addition to the data requirement and complex model\narchitecture, LLMs typically consist of billions of parameters, e.g., both Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3 (GPT-3)\nManuscript submitted to ACM\n4 Ling, et al.\n[11] and Pathways Language Model (PaLM) [ 20] contains more than 100 billion parameters, which require substantial\ncomputational power to train. Fine-tuning or re-training these models necessitates access to high-performance GPUs or\nspecialized hardware, such as TPUs, which can be expensive and difficult to obtain, especially for individual researchers\nor smaller organizations.\nOver the past few years, significant research has been conducted on domain specialization techniques for LLMs.\nMany methods focus on generic technical contributions, adaptable to specific domains with minor modifications and\naccess to domain-specific information. However, cross-referencing these techniques across different application domains\nremains a challenge, as does the absence of a systematic standardization and summary of methods for evaluating\nvarious domain specialization techniques. This lack of clarity creates obstacles for non-AI professionals and obfuscates\nexisting bottlenecks, pitfalls, open problems, and potential future research directions. To surmount these obstacles\nand harness artificial intelligence for more effectively accomplishing tasks across various domains, this survey paper\noffers a comprehensive and systematic review of the current state-of-the-art LLM domain specialization. The major\ncontributions of this paper include:\n•A systematic categorization and taxonomy of LLMs domain specialization techniques : We comprehen-\nsively classify existing methods based on different levels (i.e., black-box, grey-box, and white-box) of accessibility\nto the LLM and organize their corresponding techniques into a taxonomy. We discuss details, relationships,\npros, and cons among different subcategories. The proposed taxonomy is designed to assist domain experts in\nidentifying the most suitable techniques for their target problem settings.\n•A comprehensive categorization and summarization of major application domains : We debut the\ntaxonomy of representative application domains that domain-specialized LLMs can enhance. The practical\nsignificance and open challenges for each application domain or subdomain are elucidated, allowing for easy\nmapping to the proposed technique taxonomy. Researchers and various domain experts could cross-reference\nadditional application domains for evaluating their newly proposed methods while expanding their advanced\ntechniques to encompass new application domains.\n•An insightful discussion of the current status of research in this area and future trends . Based on\nthe comprehensive and systematic survey and investigation of existing domain specialization techniques and\napplications, an overall picture and trends of LLM domain specialization have been outlined and discussed. The\nopen challenges and The paper concludes by presenting fresh insights into the bottlenecks, open problems, as\nwell as a discussion of possible future directions.\n1.1 Related Surveys\nThis section briefly outlines previous surveys relevant to the domain specialization of LLMs in three categories: (1)\nfundamental overview of PLMs and LLMs; (2). techniques on domain adaptation and generalization of PLMs; and (3).\nSpecializing language models for specific domains.\nFundamental overview of PLMs and LLMs. While comprehensive reviews [ 101,123] of PLMs and their use in diverse\nNLP tasks exist, they don’t necessarily apply to LLMs due to differences between the two. Given the recent growth\nin popularity and effectiveness of LLMs, several review papers have emerged, addressing various LLM aspects. Some\nfocus on fundamental LLM components [ 86,173,186], others on the history and potential applications of generative\nAI [13,180], and a few [ 100] on enhancing LLMs with reasoning capabilities. However, a comprehensive review and\ntechnical taxonomy of LLM domain specialization are yet to be provided.\nManuscript submitted to ACM\nDomain Specialization as the Key to Make Large Language Models Disruptive: A Comprehensive Survey 5\nDomain adaptation and generalization of PLMs. Surveys [ 31,42] examine how to effectively and efficiently adapt\nPLMs to specific domains, such as adding a layer to the model or updating the model parameters. However, most of these\ntechniques don’t apply to LLMs because of the inaccessibility of their architecture and parameter space. Also, updating\nknowledge in LLMs is challenging due to computational costs and the need for efficient optimization strategies.\nSpecializing language models for specific domains. Recent review papers have emphasized the benefits and necessity\nof customizing LLMs for specific domains. Risks linked with applying generic LLMs to areas like medical education have\nbeen noted in [ 24,133], including lack of originality and inaccuracies. Practical considerations for legal domain-specific\nlanguage models have also been suggested in [ 139]. In the finance sector, initial steps towards a finance-specialized\nLLM have shown improved performance on financial tasks without compromising general benchmarks [ 169]. These\nadvances highlight the need for a comprehensive review and technical taxonomy of domain specialization techniques\nto assist different sectors in effectively employing LLMs for their unique tasks.\n2 TAXONOMY OF DOMAIN SPECIALIZATION\nLarge language models are typically referred to as large-scale pre-trained language models (PLMs) based on the\nTransformer architecture [ 101,123]. Empirical evidence suggests that scaling pre-trained language models, such as\nincreasing the model size or data size, frequently results in enhanced model capacity for downstream tasks. In this\nsection, we begin by reviewing the fundamental concepts of PLMs and proceed to present a comprehensive taxonomy\nof existing techniques aimed at specializing large language models for specific domains.\n2.1 Background\nSpecifically, PLM is a type of neural network pre-trained on a large corpus of text data to learn linguistic patterns,\nstructures, and semantics. The input and output of PLMs can be described as follows. In LLMs, the input is a text\nsequence that serves as context for understanding and processing. To clarify the task, a prompt , an additional sentence\nor query, is often included. These prompts, designed based on the NLP task, provide a premise or task explanation. For\ninstance, in text summarization, a prompt like \"Summarize the key points in the following passage:\" could precede the\ninput passage. The output is the text sequence or prediction generated in response to the input. Depending on the task,\nthis could be an answer to a question or a sentiment label, and may require post-processing like token decoding or label\nextraction for final presentation. As LLMs are typically scaled-up versions of PLMs, they follow the similar architecture\ndesign of PLMs, which come in three main flavors: encoder-only ,encoder-decoder , and decoder-only architectures. This\nbrief introduction will provide an overview of these PLMs architectures, and discuss their differences and commonalities.\n•Encoder-only Language Models process input text into vector representations without an explicit decoding phase\nto generate new text. Instead, they transform and embed text into a high-dimensional space. These models are\nprimarily designed to capture and understand the patterns and semantics in the input data. They are extensively\nused for tasks such as text classification, sentiment analysis, and clustering. One of the notable examples is\nBERT [ 30], which extracts context-rich embeddings for downstream tasks by pre-training on a masked language\nmodeling objective.\n•Encoder-Decoder Language Models consist of an encoder that processes input text into vector representations and\na decoder that generates output text from these representations. They employ cross-entropy loss as the objective\nfunction, comparing the actual and predicted target sequences. These PLMs are often used for sequence-to-\nsequence tasks like machine translation and summarization, with T5 [125] being a notable example.\nManuscript submitted to ACM\n6 Ling, et al.\n•Decoder-only Language Models , like GPT [ 124], are autoregressive language models that generate the next word\nin a sequence based on previous words. They map a sequence of tokens to a vector representation and generate\ncontextually relevant content autoregressively, calculating the probability of the next token based on the context.\nThis autoregressive modeling approach is particularly suitable for text-generation tasks.\n2.2 Taxonomy of Domain Specialization Techniques\nDomain Specialization of LLMsExternal Augmentation\n(Black Box)Domain Knowledge\nAugmentationUtilizing\nExplicit Knowledge\nUtilizing\nImplicit Knowledge\nDomain Tool\nAugmentationLLMs Call Domain Tools\nLLMs Embodied\nto Domain Tools\nPrompt Crafting\n(Grey Box)Discrete PromptZero-shot\nFew-shot\nContinuous PromptTask-dependent\nInstance-dependent\nModel Fine-tuning\n(White Box)Adapter-based\nFine-tuningNeural Adapter\nLow-rank Adapter\nIntegrated Adapter\nFramework\nTask-oriented\nFine-tuningInstruction-based\nFine-tuning\nPartial\nKnowledge Update\nFig. 1. The taxonomy for current techniques on LLM domain specialization.\nDomain specialization of LLMs can be understood as tailoring broad, universally-trained LLMs to operate optimally\nwithin a specific field or domain. To tackle the three challenges of domain specialization mentioned in Section 1,\nrespectively, the approaches in LLM domain specialization can be categorized into three corresponding classes of\napproaches: external augmentation ,prompt crafting , and model fine-tuning . These classes correspond to assumptions\nof different levels of accessibility to LLMs, namely, no access (black box), partial access (grey box), and full access\n(white box). The black box assumption typically indicates we only have access to the model API (e.g., ChatGPT) without\nknowing any information but the generated output; the grey box assumption denotes we have limited information (e.g.,\nthe probability of generated tokens in GPT-3 API), such information can guide us to design and fine-tune a suitable\nManuscript submitted to ACM\nDomain Specialization as the Key to Make Large Language Models Disruptive: A Comprehensive Survey 7\nTrTraining\nLLM\n General Text\nDomain Task\nTr Inferencea) Deploying LLM without Domain Specialization\nTrTraining\nLLM\n General Text\n Domain Task\nTr Inferenceb) Retrieval Augmented Domain Specialization\nExternal\nKnowledge\nTrTraining Tr Inferencec) Instruction-crafting-based Domain Specialization\nInstructions\n LLM\n General Text\n Domain Task\nTrTraining Tr Inferenced) Knowledge-updated Domain Specialization\nLLM\nDomain Task\nGeneral Text Domain-specific\nKnowledge/T ask\nFine-tune\nFig. 2. This exposition discusses different approaches for tailoring LLMs to domain-specific tasks: (a) using an LLM trained on general\ncorpora without modifications, (b) enhancing the LLM’s performance through retrieving relevant external knowledge, (c) utilizing\ndomain-specific and task-relevant instructions to improve LLM’s capabilities, and (d) updating the LLM’s internal knowledge with\ndomain-specific text and tasks.\nprompt to elicit domain knowledge better; and the white box assumption indicates we have full access to the LLM (e.g.,\nLLaMA and its variants), including the parameter setting, training data, and the model architecture.\nOther than the LLM accessibility-based taxonomy, one way to categorize LLM domain specialization methods is\nbased on the training strategy used, such as fine-tuning an existing model with domain-specific data, training a model\nfrom scratch specifically for the domain, or employing a mixed training strategy. An additional taxonomy could be based\non the intervention level: pre-training intervention involves modifying the pre-training process to encourage domain-\nspecific knowledge, the fine-tuning intervention involves adaptations during the fine-tuning stage, and inference-time\nintervention involves modifying the model’s behavior during the actual application to generate more domain-specific\noutputs. Furthermore, the taxonomy can be established based on the evaluation and feedback mechanism: fixed\nevaluation sets a constant benchmark, dynamic evaluation involves continuous performance assessment with changing\nbenchmarks, and user feedback-based evaluation uses direct user input as a signal to specialize the model’s responses.\nIn this survey, we categorize existing approaches based on the LLM’s accessibility and provide an overview of each\napproach in Figure 2. To be more specific, 1) External augmentation (black box) does not necessarily require access to\nthe LLM’s inner parameter space, making it the most accessible for users with limited resources (e.g., computational\nresources, domain-specific data). As shown in Figure 2 (b), by using external resources or tools, domain-specific\nknowledge is incorporated into the input prompt, generated output, or both, effectively adapting the LLM’s performance\nwithout modifying its internal structure. 2) prompt crafting (grey box) involves designing various types of prompts by\naccessing the gradient or loss values of LLMs, allowing for finer control over the model’s behavior. 3) model fine-tuning\n(white box) demands the most access and resources, as it involves updating the LLM’s parameters to incorporate\ndomain-specific knowledge directly into the model. (Figure 2 (d)).\nRelations between approaches in different categories.\n•Different levels of specialization : Each approach operates at a different level of specialization (i.e., black\nbox, grey box, and white box). Augmenting with external knowledge provides a focused injection of domain-\nspecific information while prompt engineering works at the input level, shaping the model’s inference process.\nFine-tuning modifies the LLM’s internal parameters, leading to more profound changes in the model’s behavior.\nManuscript submitted to ACM\n8 Ling, et al.\n•Trade-offs : The approaches exhibit different trade-offs regarding computational cost, ease of implementation,\nand generalization. Augmenting with external information and crafting task-specific instructions are often less\ncomputationally expensive than knowledge updates of LLMs but may not yield the same level of performance\nimprovement. Fine-tuning and neural adapters can provide more substantial performance gains but can be more\nchallenging to implement and may suffer from reduced generalization capabilities if overfitting occurs.\n•Complementary nature : The three approaches can be used independently or in combination to achieve better\nperformance on domain-specific tasks. For instance, external knowledge can be integrated with a fine-tuned\nLLM to leverage both specialized knowledge and optimized parameters. Similarly, carefully designed prompts\ncan be used alongside neural adapters to guide the model’s output while taking advantage of the newly learned\ndomain-specific knowledge.\nCommon Framework. Researchers can utilize these methods independently or in combination to achieve optimal\nperformance on specific tasks while considering the unique requirements and constraints of each approach. In this paper,\nwe provide a common framework underlying the black box, grey box, and white box methods for domain specialization\nof LLMs, which is a process consisting of four core stages: Definition ,Augmentation ,Optimization , and Evaluation .\n(1)Definition : This is the first step where the specific domain, the objectives within that domain, and any constraints\nare clearly defined. Whether we fine-tune a model (white box), craft prompts (grey box), or augment inputs/outputs\n(black box), it requires a clear understanding of the domain we are specializing for. This also helps in identifying\nthe specific data, knowledge, and resources relevant to the domain that could be used in the following steps.\n(2)Augmentation : This stage involves the incorporation of domain-specific knowledge into the model, or its\ninputs/outputs. In a white box approach, this could involve fine-tuning the model with domain-specific data. For\na grey box approach, it might involve using gradients or loss values to craft prompts that steer the model toward\ndomain-specific responses. In a black box method, it could involve using external tools or resources to modify\nthe input prompt or the generated output to make it more domain-specific.\n(3)Optimization : Once the model or its inputs/outputs are augmented with domain knowledge, the next step is to\noptimize the model’s performance to best fulfill the domain objectives. This can be done through methods like\ngradient descent for a white box approach, prompt engineering for a grey box approach, or post-processing and\nfiltering of outputs for a black box approach.\n(4)Evaluation : The final stage involves testing the specialized model’s performance against predefined benchmarks,\ngathering feedback, and refining the model based on this feedback. This could involve running the model on a\ndomain-specific test set or getting feedback from domain experts.\n3 EXTERNAL AUGMENTATION FOR DOMAIN SPECIALIZATION\nRetrieval augmentation aims to enhance LLMs by retrieving relevant information from external sources, without fine-\ntuning model parameters. There are two primary categories: (1) Domain Knowledge Augmentation , where LLMs\nare provided with domain-specific context from an external knowledge source, and (2) Domain Tool Augmentation ,\nwhich integrates LLMs with external systems or tools, often via APIs. Domain Knowledge Augmentation supplements\nthe model’s responses with external information, while Domain Tool Augmentation expands the model’s capabilities\nfor tasks it couldn’t perform otherwise. Domain Knowledge improves depth and accuracy within a specific field, while\nDomain Tools allow the model to perform tasks beyond its inherent abilities. This section discusses both approaches,\ntheir limitations, and their advantages.\nManuscript submitted to ACM\nDomain Specialization as the Key to Make Large Language Models Disruptive: A Comprehensive Survey 9\n3.1 Domain Knowledge Augmentation\nDomain knowledge, in the broadest sense, is a comprehensive understanding of a specific field or subject area. It includes\nconcepts, principles, facts, and patterns that are unique to a particular domain. The knowledge can be represented in\nvarious forms, including a set of documents, a domain-specific knowledge graph, or a neural network that contains\nparametric domain knowledge. Domain knowledge augmentation in LLM specification refers to the process of enriching\nan LLM’s performance in specific domains by incorporating additional information from domain knowledge. Two\ncategories of external knowledge typically can facilitate LLMs in their domain specialization: explicit knowledge refers\nto knowledge that is clearly defined, easily expressed, and structured in a manner that can be directly understood and\nutilized; and implicit knowledge refers to knowledge that is not directly stated or easily expressed, but is embedded\nwithin the data or the system, often in a latent, non-obvious form.\n3.1.1 Utilizing Explicit Knowledge with LLM. A conventional method for customizing language models to domain-\nspecific tasks is to retrieve domain-specific information from external context. When presented with an explicit\nknowledge source containing domain-specific information, it is crucial for LLMs to prioritize the context if the data\nsource holds task-relevant details that contradict the model’s memorized knowledge. This strategy ensures that model\npredictions are anchored in the context, allowing for the refinement or correction of specific model predictions without\nthe need for frequent retraining.\nCurrent techniques often employ a neural retriever to acquire task-relevant information from either a large corpus\n(e.g., Wikipedia) or a knowledge base (e.g., Wikidata) [ 10,26,44,57,74,75,83,88,143]. Specifically, given a task-specific\nquery, early works [ 10,74,83,143] designed neural retrievers to vectorize the query and all information in the external\nknowledge source to search for relevant information based on various similarity metrics (e.g., cosine similarity) in\nthe latent space. The searched information can then be concatenated with the query for downstream tasks. With the\nprevalence of LLMs, researchers have been using LLMs to replace the neural network-based retriever [ 26,57,126],\nand one work [ 57] demonstrated that coupling a rather lightweight LLM (around 11 billion parameter size) with an\nexternal knowledge base can achieve similar performance when using a 540B LLM (i.e., PaLM). Furthermore, in order\nto enhance the transparency and explainability of the retrieval, He et al. [ 44] proposed to leverage LLMs to decompose\nthe information retrieval process with detailed reasoning steps, and Lu et al. [ 88] explored to utilize LLMs to verify\nwhether information obtained by a pre-trained neural-network-based retriever is relevant or not.\n3.1.2 Utilizing Implicit Knowledge with LLM. Implicit domain knowledge in machine learning refers to latent, non-\nobvious information embedded within data or the system, often represented as vectorized knowledge or embeddings\nlearned during pre-training. Such embeddings capture intricate data patterns, symbolizing domain knowledge in\nan abstract form. Previous research [ 36,39,99,155] suggests the use of attention mechanisms to enable PLMs to\nretrieve task-related information from this implicit knowledge. These studies transform task-specific queries into latent\nembeddings, calculating attention scores between the query vector and each knowledge entry. A softmax function\nis used to generate a weight or probability distribution across all knowledge entries concerning the input query. The\nretrieved memory vector is then obtained via a weighted sum of the memory entries, using attention weights. This\nmethod enhances traditional neural networks with implicit knowledge, permitting the model to access relevant, current\ninformation during inference.\nWhile LLMs can store a substantial amount of information in their parameters to generate high-quality responses,\naugmentation with implicit knowledge isn’t always required. Unlike explicit knowledge, implicit knowledge requires\nManuscript submitted to ACM\n10 Ling, et al.\nextra processing, such as transforming domain-specific data into latent vectors, making it less practical. Despite the\nlimited work in augmenting LLMs with implicit knowledge, researchers are exploring its potential, including its use in\nstoring instructional knowledge about a domain. This approach involves creating an instruction cycle that retrieves the\nnext input prompt from implicit knowledge, parses the LLM’s output to recover variable assignments, and stores these\nback into the memory for retrieving the next instruction. Augmenting LLMs with this instruction cycle allows them to\nprocess large inputs and potentially solve complex domain-specific problems [137].\n3.1.3 Open Challenges. By incorporating external knowledge, LLMs function like librarians, finding relevant informa-\ntion without needing to memorize all resources. This enhances performance in specialized tasks without extensive\nretraining, enabling more adaptable and efficient AI systems capable of lifelong learning and knowledge updating.\nHowever, augmenting LLMs with external knowledge for domain-specific tasks presents several open challenges.\n(1)Seamless integration : Seamless integration of external knowledge into LLMs is crucial, whether the knowledge is\nexplicit or implicit. Existing methods typically concatenate retrieved knowledge to the LLM’s input or intermediate\nlayers. However, it’s important for the LLM to have the option of accepting or rejecting retrieved information,\ngiven that such information may be incomplete or conflicting.\n(2)Scalability and adaptability : Designing systems capable of scaling to manage large amounts of domain-specific\ndata and adapting to new or changing information is challenging. With rapidly expanding knowledge bases,\ncomputing pairwise knowledge similarity will become increasingly computationally unfeasible.\n3.2 Domain Tool Augmentation\nDomain tools refer to specialized software, libraries, or frameworks that are developed specifically for a particular\ndomain or field ( e.g., NCBI Web APIs for genomics question answering [ 64], automated formal theorem prover for\nmathematical proofs [ 61], sandbox environment for social behavior simulation [ 112], etc.). These tools are designed to\nhandle domain-specific tasks, data, or knowledge effectively, which often incorporate algorithms, techniques, or data\nstructures that are tailored to the unique requirements of that domain. However, the utilization of these domain tools\noften demands strict adherence to input formats or extensive training, making them less accessible to general users.\nOn the other hand, LLMs are artificial general intelligence models that exhibit intelligence and cognitive capabilities\nacross a wide range of tasks and domains. Despite their versatility, current LLMs are constrained in tasks that require\ndomain specialization. These limitations [ 100,135] include (1) unstable result formats depending on the random seeds,\ngeneration hyperparameters, and input contents [ 136]; (2) inability to access up-to-date information [ 108] since LLMs\nare solely capable of acquiring information from their training data; (3) a tendency to make up facts observed by\nresearchers [59]; (4) lack of precision in certain tasks such as arithmetic [37].\nResearchers propose a collaborative integration approach to overcome the limitations of solely using either domain\ntools or LLMs for complex domain-specific tasks. This approach combines the strengths of both, utilizing domain-specific\nknowledge, algorithms, and functionalities from the tools, while offering a user-friendly interface through LLMs. This\ncollaboration optimizes the use of domain-specific resources and eases user engagement by allowing LLMs to guide\neffective tool usage.\nLLMs Call Domain Tools. One straightforward way for domain tool augmentation is to allow LLMs to call domain\ntools. Essentially, this type of approach follows a multi-stage pipeline, given an LLM 𝑓Θ(·)and a domain toolT(·) : (1)\nelicit an executable command 𝑐for the domain tool from the LLM by curated or constructed prompts 𝑝, denoted as\nManuscript submitted to ACM\nDomain Specialization as the Key to Make Large Language Models Disruptive: A Comprehensive Survey 11\nQuestion: There are 72\nheads and 200 feet  inside\na cage. How many rabbits\nand chickens are there?Python Script\ndef solve_chicken_rabbit_problem (heads, feet):\n    a = np.array([[1, 1], [2, 4]])\n    b = np.array([heads, feet])\n    try:\n        x , y = np.linalg.solve(a, b)\n        if x >= 0 and y >= 0 and \\\n           x .is_integer () and y.is_integer ():\n            return int(x), int(y)\n        else:\n            raise ValueError\n    except:\n        print(\"No solution found.\" )\n44 Chickens\n28 Rabbits\nLLMProgram\nInterpreter\nFig. 3. A toy example for LLMs call domain tools.\n𝑐=𝑓Θ(𝑝). (2) execute the command 𝑐in the domain tool and get the outputs, denoted as 𝑟=T(𝑐). (3) post-process the\ndomain tool outputs by pre-defined rules or the LLM, denoted by 𝑦=𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑡−𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑐𝑒𝑠𝑠(𝑟).\nThis pipeline provides a general diagram and can be easily expanded to multi-LLMs multi-tools collaboration\nscenarios. The key technical challenge is to ensure the instruction-following and validity of generated commands 𝑐\nfrom LLMs, so that domain tools can accurately solve desired tasks. Most existing works propose to utilize zero-show\nor few-shot prompting for executable commands generation (please refer to Sec. 4 for more details). Figure 3 shows a\ntoy example, where the task is to solve an arithmetic question “ There are 72 heads and 200 feet inside a cage. How many\nrabbits and chickens are there? ”. To elicit LLMs to generate an executable Python program, we can formulate the prompt\nas “Please write a Python script to solve the arithmetic question. Question: {question_text} ”. Then, a snippet of scripts is\nreturned by LLM as the executable command 𝑐for the Python interpreter. Finally, the Python interpreter responds with\nthe program outputs “ 44, 28 ”, and further post-processed into desired results “ 44 Chickens and 28 Rabbits ”.\nDepending on the types of domain tools, LLMs can generate corresponding commands that adhere to the syntax and\nformat requirements to call them. Many domain tools provide APIs for easy and precise access. Early exploration in\nthis direction is to elicit elicit search engine queries ( e.g., WebGPT [ 108], WizInternet [ 69], GopherCite [ 97]) written in\nnatural language or database queries ( e.g., Binder-SQL [ 19], DIN-SQL [ 118], BIRD [ 78]) in the programming language.\nLater, researchers study how to elicit LLMs to write executable codes that can be executed in program interpreters such\nas Python [ 17,37,148], Wolfram [ 168], and so on. Other than the widely-used search queries, database queries, and\nPython programs, there exist many domain-specialized APIs that have unique syntax. For instance, chatGPT plugin\nsystem [ 109] introduces how to utilize tools for travel booking, restaurant reservation, e-commerce shopping, and\nworkflow automation. These API calling scripts are typically generated by zero-shot or few-shot prompting techniques,\nas stated in the toy example.\nSome complex tasks may involve more than one type of tool to accomplish. Following this vibe, researchers start to\ngeneralize LLMs as task planners (also mentioned as “API selectors” or “controllers”) that call multiple types of domain\ntools. Other than generating executable commands for each used tool, these approaches focus on how to decompose\na complex task into a set of concrete subtasks and how to coordinate between multiple tools. For instance, DSP [ 61]\nproposes a Draft, Sketch, and Prove framework for automated theorem proofs where (1) an LLM or oracle is used to draft\ninformal proofs described in a mixture of natural and mathematical languages from input statements, (2) another LLM\nis used to generate formal sketch from previous informal proof, and (3) off-the-shelf prover is used to prove the open\nconjectures inside each formal sketch. TaskMatrix.AI [ 81] proposes using LLMs to derive high-level solution outlines\nfor domain-specific tasks, and automatically match some of the sub-tasks in the outlines to the off-the-shelf domain\nmodels/systems to complete them. HuggingGPT [ 140] proposes leveraging LLMs to act as the controllers to manage\nexisting domain models to solve complicated domain tasks. Qin et al. [ 122] propose a general tool-augmented LLMs\nManuscript submitted to ACM\n12 Ling, et al.\nframework to decompose complex tasks into several subtasks, dynamically adjust the execution plan, and effectively\nfinish each subtask with appropriate tools.\nLLMs Embodied to Domain Tools. LLMs can also be called by domain tools to serve as smart agents in interactive\nenvironments, namely LLMs embodied to domain tools . LLMs, when embodied in interactive robots, can serve as the\ndecision-making module for domain-specific applications. For example, ProgPrompt [144] investigates LLMs’ ability\nto assist robots in completing tasks, when the robot’s perception module observes surrounding objects and the LLM is\nprompted with available action specifications. Results indicate the LLM can generate situated actions for simulated\nhousehold and real-world tabletop tasks. Furthermore, Murali et al. [ 107] employ LLMs as the primary component\nfor identifying different speakers in multiparty conversations involving a social robot. The robotics community\nis progressively exploring these areas, studying LLM utility in human-robot interfaces, planning, grounding, and\nmore [ 27,80,164]. Furthermore, researchers start to investigate how multiple LLMs can interact with the environment or\ncommunicate and collaborate together for real-world task-solving. Mind’s eye [ 84] studies how LLMs can benefit from\nthe interaction with simulated physics engines to inject grounded rationale for physics alignment tasks. CAMEL [ 76]\nproposes a communicative agent framework to assign different roles to LLM agents so that multiple AI agents can\ncollaboratively communicate by chatting with each other in an instruction-following fashion to solve the specified task.\nA recent work [ 112] utilizes twenty-five LLMs as generative agents in a game-based sandbox environment to create\nbelievable simulations of human behavior for interactive applications.\n3.2.1 Open Challenges. By leveraging the power of LLMs, domain tools can assist in a variety of tasks across multiple\nfields, including robotics, virtual agents, and problem-solving in real-world scenarios. This allows for more intuitive and\nseamless human-machine collaboration, leading to increased efficiency and adaptability in tackling complex problems.\nAugmenting LLMs with domain tools poses several open challenges:\n(1)Automated integration : At present, augmenting LLMs with domain-specific tools requires a significant amount\nof effort to ensure proper integration. A promising future direction involves utilizing LLMs as a unified inter-\nface through standardized protocols to connect various applications and services, thereby enabling seamless\ncommunication and interaction between them.\n(2)Getting rid of domain tools : Another direction for the future development of LLMs is to focus on creating a\npowerful artificial general intelligence (AGI) model that is not dependent on external tools or domain-specific\nknowledge. An AGI model would have the potential to revolutionize the way we use language models, enabling\nmore complex and sophisticated tasks to be performed with greater ease and efficiency.\n4 PROMPT CRAFTING FOR DOMAIN SPECIALIZATION\nWhile LLMs trained on large-scale corpora are powerful, further pre-training on prompts can enhance their ability to\nadhere to user intentions and generate accurate and less toxic responses [ 111,161]. Prompts, or task-specific input texts\ndesigned to elicit specific model responses, help guide the LLM’s content generation process and set expectations for\nthe desired output. Approaches generally fall into two categories: (1) Discrete Prompt involves creating task-specific\nnatural language instructions to prompt LLMs, eliciting domain-specific knowledge from their parameter space, and\n(2)Continuous Prompt uses learnable vectors to prompt LLMs, eliminating the need for manually designed text\ninstructions. This section delves into both approaches and the merits and limitations of domain specialization.\nManuscript submitted to ACM\nDomain Specialization as the Key to Make Large Language Models Disruptive: A Comprehensive Survey 13\n4.1 Discrete Prompt\nRecent works [ 11,110] allow LLMs to quickly adapt to unseen domains by discrete prompting, and GPT-3 [ 11] is the\nfirst work that introduces how to perform an unseen task using an LLM with zero-shot/few-shot discrete prompts\nwithout updating the LLM’s inner parameter. We give a formal definition of the discrete prompt framework below.\nProblem Setup. Given an LLM 𝑓Θ(·)where Θdenotes pre-trained model parameters, the task is to elicit desired output\n𝒚from LLM with a discrete prompt 𝑝and a test query, denoted as 𝒚=𝑓Θ([𝑝;𝒄]), when freezing Θ. It is worth noting\nthat both 𝒚,𝑝and𝒄are sequences of tokens (i.e., natural language sentences). The rationale behind using discrete\nprompts is that they can serve as instructions to elicit the generalized reasoning abilities of LLMs. By following such\ninstructions, LLMs can perform domain-specific tasks that they have not been specifically trained for. This approach\nallows LLMs to demonstrate their ability to apply previously learned knowledge to new and diverse situations, thus\nenhancing their overall effectiveness and utility.\nDepending on the prompting types, discrete prompts can be divided into two categories: (1) zero-shot [ 7,68,134],\nwhere the prompt 𝑝consist of only the task description; and (2) few-shot [ 90,102,167], where the prompt 𝑝consists\nof the task description and few illustrative examples. The key difference between zero-shot and few-shot prompts is\nwhether or not illustrative examples are provided.\n4.1.1 Zero-shot Discrete Prompts. The zero-shot setting represents the cold-start scenario, where not a single supportive\nlabeled example is available.\n# Task description\nPlease determine if the two sentences entail, con-\ntradict, or are neutral to each other.\n# Test query\nPremise : She emerged vigorous with Apgar of 7\nand 8.\nHypothesis : She had low APGAR scores.\nAnswer :\n# LLM response\nLLM :Contradiction\nFig. 4. An example (adapted from [ 70]) of zero-shot discrete\nprompts, where task description, and/or a test query are provided to\nLLMs. No illustrative examples are provided in zero-shot prompts.Figure 4 presents a toy example of how zero-shot dis-\ncrete prompts work. The task description that compro-\nmises the prompt 𝑝can be curated by human users or\nautomatically generated by templates, where the intent of\nthe task and the expected outcomes are described in nat-\nural language. However, as stated in [ 136], post-process\nis sometimes required to extract the rigorous prediction\nresults from the unbounded raw outputs. Researchers\ndemonstrate that instruction alignment pre-training en-\nables decent zero-shot performance on various unseen\ntasks [ 11,134,165], where different tasks can be repre-\nsented in a unified sequence generation format. PADA [ 7]\nis one of the pioneering works that explore how to elicit\nthe domain adaptation ability of LLMs for domains un-\nseen during the training phase. PADA first generates the\ntarget domain name followed by a set of domain-related features related to the test query, and then uses them together\nas the prompt to predict task labels. Follow-up works explore how to utilize zero-shot discrete prompt for domain\nadaptation in sentiment analysis [ 60], image classification [ 38], semantic segmentation [ 35], and rumor detection [ 82].\nLater, Kojima et al. [ 68] extend the few-shot-Chain-of-Thoughts(Few-shot-CoT) [ 167] into zero-shot-CoT to elicit\nmulti-step reasoning ability of LLMs. The core idea of Zero-shot-CoT is a two-stage prompting, where the 1st stage\nsimply adds the same prompt “ Let’s think step by step ” before each answer to derive the reasoning process sentences,\nand the 2nd stage takes the generated reasoning sentences to generate the final answer. Zero-shot-CoT has achieved\nManuscript submitted to ACM\n14 Ling, et al.\nsignificantly stronger performance than the standard zero-shot prompting method on arithmetic, symbolic reasoning,\nand other logical reasoning tasks.\n4.1.2 Few-shot Discrete Prompts. The few-shot setting reflects the characteristics of sparse training samples of many\ndomain-specific applications (i.e., only a few annotated examples are available).\n# Task description\nPlease determine if the two sentences entail,\ncontradict, or are neutral to each other. Below are\nseveral examples.\n# Example 1\nPremise : ALT, AST, and lactate were elevated as\nnoted above.\nHypothesis : The patient has abnormal lfts.\nAnswer : Entailment\n# Example 2\nPremise : Chest x-ray showed mild congestive\nheart failure.\nHypothesis : The patient complains of cough.\nAnswer : Neutral\n# Test query\nPremise : She emerged vigorous with Apgar of 7\nand 8.\nHypothesis : She had low APGAR scores.\nAnswer :\n# LLM response\nLLM :Contradiction\nFig. 5. An example (adapted from [ 70]) of few-shot discrete\nprompts, where task description, illustrative examples, and/or\na test query are provided to LLMs. Compared to zero-shot\nprompts, a few supportive labeled samples are provided in few-\nshot prompts.Figure 5 presents a toy example of how few-shot dis-\ncrete prompts work. Different from zero-shot prompts, a\nfew examples that further convey the task intention and\nprovide illustrations of the desired output formats are in-\ncluded in the prompt 𝑝. Researchers have observed that\nfew-shot prompts yield more stable output formats and\nmore decent performance on downstream tasks [ 11,110].\nChain-of-Thought (CoT) [ 167] improves the domain spe-\ncialization ability of LLMs by introducing a series of inter-\nmediate reasoning steps for complex reasoning tasks, but\nit also brings extra cost in manually designing CoTs for\neach test example. As a follow-up, Auto-CoT [ 184] elim-\ninates manual designs by appending the “ Let’s think step\nby step ” prompt to the given task context and letting LLMs\ngenerate reasoning chains directly. Other than the natu-\nral language format instructions, CoCoGen [ 90] studies\nthe programming language format instructions to tackle\nstructured reasoning tasks.\nMore advanced techniques are then proposed to fur-\nther improve discrete instruction of LLMs for domain\nspecialization and customization. For instance, ensemble-\nbased instruction [89,159,160] utilizes multiple different\ninstructions to derive multiple model outputs and then\naggregates these outputs to achieve better task perfor-\nmance. Another line of research proposes recursive instruc-\ntion[2,32,33,67,172,187] to breaks down a complex un-\nseen task into a series of subtasks that are relatively easier\nto solve and then employs LLMs with specific instructions\nfor each subtask.\n4.1.3 Open Challenges. Utilizing discrete prompts helps LLMs leverage their inherent knowledge to adapt to new and\ndiverse situations. This approach not only demonstrates the flexibility and adaptability of LLMs but also enhances their\noverall effectiveness and utility across a wide range of domains and tasks. However, crafting discrete prompts of LLMs\nfor domain specialization poses several open challenges:\n(1)Effectiveness : Often the discrete instructions are curated by domain experts or follow some types of templates. It\nis arguable whether the instructions used are the most effective ones. Therefore, there is a need for evaluation\nManuscript submitted to ACM\nDomain Specialization as the Key to Make Large Language Models Disruptive: A Comprehensive Survey 15\nof these instructions. This can be achieved through collaboration between domain experts and data scientists,\nwho can analyze the performance of the LLMs and adjust the instructions accordingly. An automatic evaluation\nwould be even better.\n(2)Scalability and adaptability : Automated ways to generate and select/combine discrete instructions without\nexcessive human intervention is another promising direction to improve discrete instructions of LLMs.\n4.2 Continuous Prompt\nSimilar to discrete prompts, the continuous prompt is a sequence of tokens proposed to attach with the input sentence\nand guide LLMs with extra knowledge but can be learned from the downstream dataset by continuous prompt tuning .\nIn this case, the continuous prompt serves as a softparameterized prompt instead of the hard-coded instruction as\ndiscrete language phrases. Prompt tuning is to optimize the prompt that adapts an LLM to customized tasks or domains\nwith the preservation of LLM’s general language understanding ability. Here, one can solely update prompt-related\nparameters, whose quantity is around only 0.01%of the total number of the LLM’s parameters, while freezing the LLM\nitself during the fine-tuning phase.\nFig. 6. An illustration of soft prompt tuning. Fire icon represents tunable modules and ice icon represents that parameters of those\nmodules are frozen during tuning. Verbalizer are only used for classification task where a mapping from class label to label words is\nrequired, which can be one-one mapping, trainable tokens [43], or enhanced with extra knowledge [53].\nA general framework of continuous prompt tuning (Figure 6) can be concisely described in the following stages:\n(1) Given an input sentence 𝒄and its corresponding target 𝒚, a template function 𝑇(·)organizes them along with\na prompt 𝝉of length𝑚into a new sentence 𝑇(𝝉,𝒄)={𝝉0:𝑖,𝒄,𝝉𝑖+1:𝑚}. (2) Subsequently, the sequence 𝑇(𝝉,𝒄)is\nmapped into an embedding space using model’s input layer 𝒆(·), resulting in the sequence of token embeddings:\n𝑇𝑒(𝝉,𝒄)={𝒆(𝜏1),...,𝒆(𝜏𝑖),𝒆(𝜔1),...,𝒆(𝜔𝑛),𝒆(𝜏𝑖+1),...,𝒆(𝜏𝑚)},where𝜏𝑖is the𝑖-th token in the prompt and 𝑇𝑒(·)denotes\nthe sequence in the embedding space. To perform prompt tuning, 𝝉is considered as pseudo tokens without explicit\nsemantic meanings, and thus 𝒆(𝜏𝑖)is replaced with a trainable tensor 𝒉(𝜏𝑖)reparameterized by 𝜽𝜏. This modifies\nthe template to: 𝑇′\n𝑒(𝝉,𝒄)={𝒉(𝜏1),...,𝒉(𝜏𝑖),𝒆(𝑥1),...,𝒆(𝑥𝑛),𝒉(𝜏𝑖+1),...,𝒉(𝜏𝑚)}.(3) Finally, we can feed the embedding\nsequence to an LLM, and optimize the continuous prompts 𝜽𝜏using the downstream loss function Las follows:\n𝜽𝜏★=𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑚𝑎𝑥\n𝜽𝜏L(𝑓Θ(𝑇′\n𝑒(𝝉,𝒄)),𝒚),\nwhere𝑓Θ(·)is the LLM function parametrized by Θ. For a cloze-style input reformulated from general tasks, for example,\nthe sentiment analysis task for the sentence “I like the movie!\" can be rephrased as a cloze-completion problem: “I like\nthe movie! It was [MASK].\". The predicted words at the masked position are then employed for subsequent classification.\nIn this case, a unique token [MASK] is integrated during the generation of the template in step (1), and a verbalizer 𝜙is\nrequired to map class labels to words in the language model’s vocabulary, e.g., positive→‘great’ , resulting in:\n𝜽𝜏★=𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑚𝑎𝑥\n𝜽𝜏∑︁\n𝒄log𝑃\u0010\n[𝑀𝐴𝑆𝐾]=𝜙(𝒚)|𝑇′\n𝑒(𝝉,𝒄)\u0011\nManuscript submitted to ACM\n16 Ling, et al.\nThe information condensed by the prompt falls into two categories: (1) task-dependent prompt tuning , and (2)\ninstance-dependent prompt tuning . Each category encompasses general and specific enhancements for domain and\ntask adaptation. Although some studies are based on PLMs, the advantages apply to LLMs, given the correlation between\nprompt tuning enhancements and model size [ 72] and successful implementations on large-scale PLMs. Moreover, it\nprovides a parameter-efficient, fully controllable tuning method to adapt PLMs for more customized purposes.\n4.2.1 Task-dependent Prompt Tuning. Task-dependent prompt tuning optimizes a shared prompt for all instances\nwithin a specific task, enabling it to encapsulate information from extensive datasets comprising thousands or millions\nof examples. However, training a naïve prompt is hard to converge and suboptimal for different scenarios, leaving room\nfor improvement for specific tasks and domains.\nPrompt Content Enhancement. We refer prompt content as the embedding values of continuous prompt, enhancements\nare developed in terms of task-specific initialization and prior knowledge transfer. Pilot works have validated that in\ncontrast to many optimizers that begin with a random distribution applied in general ML tasks, the optimization process\nof soft prompt is significantly influenced by its initial value. For language models, word embeddings are pre-trained\nto be quite distinct. Consequently, a standard optimizer such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD) can only update\nthe parameters in a limited vicinity, leading to the possibility of falling into a local minimum [ 1]. Therefore, a more\neffective initialization approach would involve using embeddings of concrete task-specific words.\nOne of the pioneering works, WARP [ 43] initializes the prompt by the embedding of special token “[MASK]”.\nKnowPrompt [ 18] designed learnable prompts as virtual type words and virtual answer words, which are initialized\nby the aggregated representation of concrete label words and disassembling words based on their frequency in the\ndataset. In addition, random initialization has been proven to be the least efficient, especially for small model, while\nPrompt-tuning [ 72] presented no significant gap between initialization strategies when the model size grows to 11B,\nindicating that LLMs is robust for prompt’s initialization values in general tasks.\nFurther studies have revealed that retrained prompts on source domains can enhance performance in unseen\ntarget domains, illustrating the ability of prompt transfer [ 153]. SPoT [ 153] initialize the prompt with a single generic\nsource prompt learnt from multiple sources tasks, and then fine-tune it on target task in a classic way [ 72]. PPT\n[40] also pre-trains a prompt using self-supervised learning on extensive unlabeled corpora, which then serves as\nthe initial prompt for the target task. Su et al. [ 145] demonstrated the transferability of continuous prompts in both\ncross-task as well as cross-model settings, and find that a well-initialized prompt can significantly accelerate training\nconvergence. Furthermore, take the advantage of transferability, LFPT5 [ 121] employed soft prompt for lifelong learning.\nIt continuously trains the prompt that simultaneously learns to solve the current task and generate training samples of\nprevious tasks to overcome the catastrophic forgetting . Progressive prompts [ 128] introduce the prompt tuning into\ncontinuous learning. The prompt for current task is defined as the concatenation of prompts that are optimized on\nprevious tasks and a tunable current prompt.\nPrompt Construction Enhancement. We refer to the prompt construction about the positioning and length of the\nprompt, and combinations of additional templates or discrete prompts. Continuous prompts can be simply prepended,\nappended, and inserted to the original input sentences without extra language phrases. The pioneering study, WARP\n[43] adopted all three intersections with a “[MASK]” token for classification tasks. In Prefix-tuning [ 79], tunable prompts\nare prepended to the sentence embedding and the activation of all attention blocks, capitalizing on the left-to-right\nManuscript submitted to ACM\nDomain Specialization as the Key to Make Large Language Models Disruptive: A Comprehensive Survey 17\nnature of the autoregressive model: the prepended prompt can efficiently affect the subsequent words through attention.\nIn addition, a recent work [ 72] prepend prompts at the input layer, achieving comparable results to fine-tuned models.\nTemplate is widely used to leverage the adaptation performance [ 136], for example, reformulating an NLP task (e.g.,\nsentence classification) into the masked words prediction task that is employed during LM pre-training. Based on\nthe predefined task-specific templates, soft prompts can be inserted and thus offers flexibility for conditional tuning.\nKnowPrompt [ 18] designed a template appending to the input sentence with a “[MASK]” between subject and object\nfor relation extraction and incorporates trainable prompts of “virtual type words” surrounding these two entities.\nOutput embeddings of “virtual type words” are trained to align logically with the target relation at the masked position,\nconditioning the optimization with the information of entity type. KiPT [ 77] developed a knowledge extractor for event\ndetection tasks, which identifies trigger words in sentences based on their semantic similarity to event concepts above\na threshold. Identified trigger words as well as the corresponding event labels will then be prepended to a randomly-\ninitialized soft prompt with the input sentence. KiPT also reformulates the sequence tagging tasks: trigger-identification\nand trigger classification, into the generative task by outputting structured event records.\n4.2.2 Instance-dependent prompt tuning. A shared task-dependent prompt is static against the change in input sentence,\nwhich ignores semantic differences as well as specific knowledge of individual instances, and thus be suboptimal in\nfine-grained objectives. Instance-dependent prompt tuning however conditionally generates prompts for individual\ninstances, incorporating both contextual information and task instructions.\nPrompt Content Enhancement. Enhancement of prompt content for instance-dependent tuning focus on learning a\njoint and adaptive representation of tasks as well as instance context. IDPG [ 170] proposed an additional two-layer\nperceptron as a prompt generator, down and up project the sentence embedding to the adaptive soft prompt. ATTEMPT\n[3] first train multiple prompts on large-scale source tasks, and calculate an aggregated prompt base on a sentence-wise\nattention network, which will then be mixed with a newly initialized target task prompt as the final instance-dependent\nprompt. Jin et al., [ 63] assume that prompt tokens differently contribute the instance, and thus designed a look-up\nmodule to score the association of prompt tokens to instance tokens, which is then used to calculate the aggregated\nprompt embeddings. Bhardwaj et al., [ 8] generate context-aware prompts by a transformer-based sentence encoder, but\nfurther quantize the contextual prompt into a more compact representation to avoid optimization collapse. Levine et\nal., [73] learn the joint representation of prompt and input by a frozen T5 encoder following cross- and self-attention\nlayers. Liu et al., [ 85] propose an instance-aware prompt that is applied to the intermediate layers of LM. The proposed\nprompt generator is a simple feed-forward layer with bottleneck architecture which take the embedding of [CLS] token\nor pooling of embeddings of sentence tokens.\nPrompt Construction Enhancement. Similar to the construction enhancement, instance-dependent prompt tuning\nintroduce instance-dependent knowledge as concrete words or learn adaptive prompt in terms of positioning and length.\nOntoPrompt [ 177] enriches the template with instance-related knowledge from external ontology as an additional\ntext, and tune continuous prompts surrounding the “[MASK]\" to help prediction. Recently, to give a comprehensive\ndiscussion of the effect of content and structure of prompts, dynamic prompting [ 175] proposed a unified framework to\nlearn an instance-dependent prompt by dynamically defining prompt position, length, and values for each instance. It\nalso proves the effectiveness of post-fix prompt, given most prior works prepend the prompt to the input sentence.\n4.2.3 Open Challenges. Continuous prompt tuning presents a streamlined method to utilize the broad language\nunderstanding capacity of LLMs for specific tasks across different domains. It efficiently tackles issues inherent in\nManuscript submitted to ACM\n18 Ling, et al.\ndiscrete prompt methods, such as (1) significant reliance on the prompt for LLM performance, where minor wording or\ntemplate changes can greatly affect the result, (2) computational complexity in identifying the optimal natural language-\nbased prompt from a large search space, and (3) the time-consuming and labor-intensive process of manually designing\ninstructions, particularly in expertise-required domains. However, continuous prompt tuning has its limitations.\n(1)Interpretability is often criticized as a weakness of soft prompt tuning. By discreting the optimal continuous\nprompts into nearby token vectors in LM’s vacabulary, studies such as WARP [ 43] have found these prompts\nto be non-interpretable and lacking meaningful content. In KnowPrompt [18] and Prompt-tuning [72], prompt\ntokens are discovered in close proximity to domain-related terms. For example, Prompts trained on the BoolQ\ndataset revealed that science ,technology , and engineering were the nearest neighbors of the optimal prompt, as\napproximately 20%of the questions pertain to the “Nature/Science” category [ 72]. However, the interpretability\nof continuous prompts as a coherent sequence is still unclear. In addition, continuous prompt is not confined\nto directing LLMs using compact textual information. OPTIMA [ 41] achieves domain adapting with prompt\nby tuning it help regularizes the decision boundary to be smooth around regions where source and target data\ndistributions are similar with an adversarial learning framework.\n(2)Limited access to LLMs poses a significant challenge for continuous prompt learning, especially as models\nwith immense sizes (e.g., 540B PaLM) and models with only API access. This restriction hinders differential\noptimization on continuous embeddings. In this case, derivative-free prompt tuning that optimizes the soft\nprompt without gradients from LLMs is widely discussed. Black-box tuning (BBT) [ 146] proposed a gradient-free\napproach to searching the optimal prompt in a smaller intrinsic space. with Covariance Matrix Adaptation\nEvolution Strategy (CMA-ES) for non-convex optimization instead of Adam. Similarly, Clip-Tuning [ 14] use\nmultiple deterministic clipping instances of the target LM to optimize an agent that learns the intrinsic prompt\nembedding. However, those methods still need access at least to the embedding layer, which is unsatisfactory for\nLLMs where only textual query is allowed. In this case, derivative-free approaches for discrete prompt search\nappear to be a more promising direction, and several studies have already achieved preliminary success [ 29,119].\n5 MODEL FINE-TUNING FOR DOMAIN SPECIALIZATION\na) Adapter -based Fine-tuning\nb) Task-oriented Fine-tuning\n Domain-specific Knowledge\nLLM\nFig. 7. The visualization of two approaches to fine-tune LLMs based on domain-\nspecific knowledge, where the blue rectangle denotes the set of parameters in\nLLM. (a) the adapter-based LLM fine-tuning aims to fine-tune LLMs on specific\ndomains with a small number of extra parameters (i.e., adapter); and (b) the\ntask-oriented model fine-tuning aims to fine-tune LLMs based on specific tasks.LLMs, despite being trained on extensive gen-\neral text data, might not encode adequate\nknowledge for specific tasks or domains. In\nsuch scenarios, fine-tuning the model on a\nsmaller, domain-specific dataset can enhance\nits performance within that particular area.\nThis fine-tuning can be divided into two\nmain approaches. Adapter-based Fine-tuning\nand Task-oriented Fine-tuning. (1) Adapter-\nbased Fine-tuning: This approach, as illus-\ntrated in Figure 7 (a), employs neural adapters or modular components to enhance the LLM’s performance on domain-\nspecific tasks without major modifications to the LLM’s inner parameters. These adapters, typically integrated into\nthe existing LLM architecture, allow for task-specific learning while keeping the original model largely intact. (2)\nTask-oriented Fine-tuning: As represented in Figure 7 (b), this method focuses on modifying the LLM’s inner\nManuscript submitted to ACM\nDomain Specialization as the Key to Make Large Language Models Disruptive: A Comprehensive Survey 19\nparameters to improve alignment with specific tasks. However, entirely updating all parameters of an LLM may be\nimpractical due to hardware limitations and potential performance degradation. Therefore, the challenge for researchers\nlies in identifying which parameters require alteration within the expansive parameter space, or in efficiently updating\na subset of these parameters. These two approaches allow LLMs to be tailored to specific tasks or domains, offering\nflexibility and efficiency in handling specialized applications.\n5.1 Adapter-based Fine-tuning\nAdapter-based fine-tuning aims to add a small number of extra parameters to the LLM for achieving better performance\nin specific tasks. Typically the additional parameters are encoded in simple modules to guide the language model’s\nadaptation to target domains or tasks. The golden spots for the added modules include: (1) simple with a small number\nof parameters; (2) extensible to the original language models; (3) flexible with sequential training on each specific\ndomain. Most of the proposed strategies with the above favorable properties are built on adapters [ 49,129] under the\numbrella of parameter-efficient fine-tuning.\n5.1.1 Adapters. Adapters are trainable modules inserted between layers of a pre-trained model [ 49]. The key property of\nadapters highlights that the parameters of the original language model keep frozen, thus provide sustainable parameter\nsharing even with varying domains and tasks. Suppose 𝑓Θ(·)denotes the function of LLM parametrized with the set of\nparameters Θand𝑔ΔΘ(·)denotes the function of adapters with parameter ΔΘ, then𝑓Θ◦𝑔ΔΘrepresents the fine-tuned\nlanguage model by adapters. Let 𝑋be general input data with task performance metric 𝜙, and𝐷be the domain training\ndata with domain-specific task performance 𝜙𝐷(for both𝜙and𝜙𝐷, a higher value indicates better performance), the\ngoal of adapters is to find 𝑔ΔΘsuch that:\n𝜙(𝑓Θ(𝑋))≈𝜙(𝑓Θ◦𝑔ΔΘ(𝑋))𝜙𝐷(𝑓Θ(𝐷))≤𝜙𝐷(𝑓Θ◦𝑔ΔΘ(𝐷))\nDespite most empirical studies on cross-lingual or multi-task learning, some recent works explore unsupervised\ndomain adaptation particularly using adapters. Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) using adapters has been\nexplored in recent work, aiming to enhance the cross-lingual or multi-task learning capabilities of pre-trained models.\nThe first attempt [ 183] targeted multi-domain adaptation with a two-step strategy: domain-fusion training with Masked\nLanguage Model (MLM) loss on a mixed corpus, followed by task fine-tuning with a task-specific loss on the domain\ncorpus. Subsequently, UDApter was introduced, which also adopted the two-step training and fine-tuning approach, but\nsegregated this into two adapter modules: a domain adapter and a task adapter. The domain adapter first learned domain-\ninvariant representations, which were then concatenated with the task adapter whose parameters were frozen [ 92].\nThis was achieved using the architecture defined in AdapterFusion [ 114]. AdapterSoup further improved adaptation\nefficiency by adopting a weight-average of domain adapters only during the testing phase [ 22]. To select domain\nadapters, three strategies were explored: exhaustive combination, text clustering, and semantic similarity.\nThough these works focused on domain specialization, they were evaluated on pre-trained language models like\nGPT-2 [ 22,92,183], indicating potential applicability to larger language models. To address this, LLaMA-adapter was\ndesigned for efficient adaptation on Large Language Models with Adapters (LLaMAs) using self-instruct demonstrations.\nThe adapter architecture incorporated a zero-init attention mechanism, and the domain specialization capability was\ntested on instruction-following and multi-modal reasoning tasks [182].\nAs the application of adapters expands, several techniques, while not explicitly claimed as effective for domain\nspecialization, have either demonstrated potential by offering favorable performance on downstream tasks or served\nManuscript submitted to ACM\n20 Ling, et al.\nas integrated components in existing frameworks for domain specialization. Hence, adapters are usually classified\nbased on their architectures into neural adapters and low-rank adapters. With the objective of facilitating user-friendly\nimplementation, a growing body of work is dedicated to building comprehensive frameworks of different adapters\n[54,115]. Certain studies have also shown that adapter integration can yield superior performance across a variety of\ndownstream tasks.\nNeural adapters. We call adapters with neural network architectures neural adapters. In their original design, [ 49]\nuses a composition of down-projection, GeLU non-linearity [ 47] and up-projection with the feed-forward layers as the\nbackbone. Later [ 6] simplifies the architecture to a single hidden-layer feed-forward network and demonstrates the\neffectiveness on domain adaptation. The adapter modules are inserted after the multi-head attention and feed-forward\nlayers in the transformer. These adapters have been named as bottleneck adapters or serial adapters. We use the latter\nthroughout this paper when referring to [49].\nThe development of neural adapters naturally takes inspiration from neural network architecture design, such as\nResNet, autoencoder, attention mechanism, etc. The adapters used in [ 114] have an additional residual connection. Soon\nafter, [ 116] proposes MAD-X framework with invertible adapters, which are inserted adjacent to input and inverted to\nbe fed into the output embeddings. At the high-level, invertible adapters can be considered a mimic of autoencoders.\nTiny-attention adapter [185] explores the effectiveness of adapters using attention with tiny per-head dimensionality.\nTill now, most proposed architectures apply fully-connected layers for down-projection and up-projection in adapters.\nHowever, Compacters [ 66] considers parameterized hypercomplex multiplication layers [ 179] as an alternative, which\nhas a similar form as a fully-connected layer, but learns a sum of Kronecker products. The main advantage is parameter\nefficiency. Another way of achieving this is inspired by network pruning, as proposed by SparseAdapter[ 46] to further\nreduce the training parameters by pruning at initialization. Note that SparseAdapter is a generic technique applicable\nto neural adapters. Congregating adapters via insertion can be considered as adaptation inside the language models, an\nalternative is adaptation outside the language models. 𝐾-adapters [ 158] proposes to train multiple adapters individually\non various knowledge domains, then inject the learned knowledge with language models by concatenation. Recently,\nSung et al. [ 147] raises a concern on the high training memory required because the backpropagation flows throug the\nlanguage model with inserted adapters in entirety. They further propose ladder side-tuning, which only adds small\nmodules on the side of the language model connected to the language model backbone via shortcuts. Both techniques\nuse MLP for demonstration, but keep flexible with different adapter architectures.\nLow-rank adapters. Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) [ 52] is inspired by the observation that large language models reside\non an intrinsic subspace [ ?], where model parameters are efficiently updated. Therefore, learning in this subspace\nsignificantly reduces the amount of parameters. LoRA modules implant learnable SVD blocks as the subspace with a\nlow matrix rank 𝑟≪𝑑, where𝑑is the dimension of input data. The matrices are added in parallel to the pre-trained\nweights, thus keeping them frozen during the fine-tuning. Notably, LoRA shows superiority in further reducing the\nnumber of trained parameters and introducing no latency during inference.\nA follow-up work on this line is DyLora [ 150], which addresses two issues of LoRA using dynamic search: fixed block\nsize and exhaustive search on the optimal rank. Recently, another concern of LoRA was raised that low-rank modules have\nlimited representation power, and further resolved by the Kronecker adapter (KronA) [ 34]. The essence is to substitute\nthe SVD modules with a Kronecker product module with two matrices of smaller sizes. Despite not many follow-ups on\nthe low-rank adapters, LoRA modules are included in various integrated adaptation frameworks [ 45,54,93,162] as an\nimportant building block. More details on these frameworks follow below.\nManuscript submitted to ACM\nDomain Specialization as the Key to Make Large Language Models Disruptive: A Comprehensive Survey 21\nIntegrated adapter framework. With the flourishing results on effective adapters as introduced above, it is a natural\nextension to incorporate several adapters of various families to boost their performance. AdapterFusion [ 114] employs a\nstraightforward idea: train multiple adapters on different tasks and combine the learned embeddings from each adapter\nwith a fusion layer. UniPELT [ 93] proposes to activate different combinations of methods that best suit the current\ndata or task setup via a gating mechanism. The sub-modules included serial adapter [ 49], LoRA [ 52], Prefix-tuning [ 79]\nand Bitfit [ 178]. Orthogonal to UniPELT, AdaMix [ 162] stacks multiple adapters of the same type, but avoids more\ncomputational cost by training the activation with stochastic routing. AdaMix can be regarded as a general technique\nthat applies to any adapter, despite their implementation on only serial adapters and LoRA.\nThe idea of learning a routing function on an inventory of adapters further inspires follow-up works. In the context\nof multi-task learning, Polytropon [ 117] jointly learns an inventory of adapters and a routing function to re-combine\nthe fine-tuned adapters of various sizes shared among different tasks. Variants of this scheme are further studied\nby [12], including the replacement of the routing function with weights averaging, or multi-head routing function to\nachieve better expressivity. On the implementation-oriented aspect, AdapterHub [ 115] is the most comprehensive and\neasy-to-use library integrating all mainstream adapters. The only downside, however, is the absence of support of large\nlanguage models. Recently, LLM-adapters [ 54] introduces a framework including open-access large language models\nsuch as LLaMA, OPT, GPT-J, etc. It subsumes four adapters as basic components (Serial adapter [ 49], MAD-X [ 116],\nParallel adapter [ 176] and LoRA [ 52]) and remains extensible to new modules. The study of domain specialization\nfurther explores mathematical reasoning.\n5.1.2 Open Challenges. The adapter’s wide applications stem from its modular compatibility with language models,\nflexible design for integration, and efficient domain-specific data fine-tuning, advancing the adapter-based fine-tuning\nparadigm. However, these methods have drawbacks. Firstly, the performance of inserted modules can be sensitive\nto architectural design and size across different tasks and domains, risking insufficient representational power or\noverfitting on limited data. Secondly, additional modules enlarge the model size, imposing new resource demands and\npossibly extending inference time. Lastly, as Sung et al. note, the training memory needed by adapter-based methods\nremains substantial as backpropagation involves the entire model even when previous parameters are frozen [ 147].\nGiven these discussions, we outline the open challenges in applying adapters to LLMs for domain specialization:\n(1)Stability and universality: The performance of adapters can be subject to various architecture or hyper-parameters\napplied even on pre-trained language models (PTLMs), thus imposes a question mark on the stability and\nuniversality. This concern further extends to LLMs. A deeper understanding on how different adapters match\nwith different task settings would be a significant boost to broader applications of adapters.\n(2)Computational resources: Adapters have shown remarkable results with a million-size of parameters on PTLMs.\nHowever, it remains unproven if they are enough for LLMs. If more adapter modules (more parameters) are\nrequired, then the issue of computational cost can be raised again. Another ideal spot on this issue is to reduce\nthe training memory with novel architecture design or fine-tuning strategy.\n5.2 Task-oriented Fine-tuning\nDespite these incredible capabilities of LLMs trained on large text corpus, fundamentally improving the model perfor-\nmances beyond few-shot examples and auxiliary adapters still requires updating the inner parameters of LLMs on an\nextensive amount of high-quality domain-specific datasets. However, fine-tuning an LLM on any (domain) specific\ntasks poses two challenges: 1) updating LLM’s global knowledge may destroy the in-context learning ability due to\nManuscript submitted to ACM\n22 Ling, et al.\nLLMTask Pool\nmachine Translation\nNeural Reasoning\n......\nTask: Commonsense Reasoning\nPick the most likely answer to the following question: \nQuestion: How many wings does a sparrow have?\nA.

The overview of fine-tuning an LLM with explicit instructions across various domains and datasets. Particularly, the LLM is\nfine-tuned on a collection of tasks (e.g., commonsense reasoning, information extraction, etc.) with detailed instructions, and the\nfine-tuned LLM is expected to obtain problem-solving skills.\nreasons including but not limited to overfitting, catastrophic forgetting, and task-specific biases [ 163]. 2) fine-tuning\nLLMs is computationally expensive due to the vast parameter space and the deep model architecture. In this section, we\nreview recent techniques on how to update the global knowledge of LLMs, which can be primarily categorized into two\nareas: Instruction-based Fine-tuning andPartial Knowledge Update to address both challenges, respectively.\n5.2.1 Instruction-based Knowledge Update. Instruction-based Knowledge Update refers to updating an LLM’s parametric\nknowledge by fine-tuning LLMs on a diverse set of tasks with explicit instructions or prompts, which is conceptually\nthe same as Instruct Learning introduced in [ 111]. An illustration of fine-tuning an LLM with instructions is provided\nin Figure 8, where an LLM is fine-tuned on a collection of tasks across the whole NLP application domain, and the\nLLM is deployed on the held-out and unseen tasks. Wei et al. f[ 165] provided the very first attempt to fine-tune LLMs\nbased on a collection of datasets described via instructions. Empirically, effective instructions can substantially improve\nzero-shot performance on unseen tasks. The instruction-tuned language model FLAN is fine-tuned on a 137B LLM over\n60 NLP datasets using natural language instruction templates. The study shows that FLAN outperforms its unmodified\ncounterpart and even surpasses both zero-shot and few-shot 175B GPT-3 on most unseen tasks. Subsequently, in\nrecent works by [ 23,56,98], explicit instructions have been employed to fine-tune LLMs, with emphasis placed on (1)\nexpanding the number of tasks, (2) enlarging the model’s size, and (3) fine-tuning on chain-of-thought data. As a result,\nthe fine-tuned LLM attains state-of-the-art performance on numerous benchmarks in both zero/few-shot NLP tasks.\nFine-tuning with Human Instructions. Fine-tuning with human instructions aims to guide LLMs towards generating\nsafer, truthful, less toxic content in line with user intentions. Most LLMs utilize autoregressive approaches, making the\ngenerated content largely influenced by the training corpus distribution and less controllable. Reinforcement learning\nfrom human feedback (RLHF) is a notable technique for aligning LLM content with human needs [ 21]. In RLHF: 1) LLMs\ncreate multiple content options for a prompt, ranked by humans for quality, relevance, and desired output alignment; 2)\nan external reward model assigns scores to content based on rankings, capturing evaluator preferences; 3) model policy\nis updated using reinforcement learning techniques to maximize expected reward, fine-tuning the model to better align\nwith human preferences; 4) this process of content generation, ranking, reward modeling, and policy optimization\nrepeats in iterations, with the model continually learning from human feedback. Existing methods successfully apply\nRLHF to fine-tune LLMs on complex reasoning tasks using human instructions [113, 156].\nPotential Limitations of Instruction-based Knowledge Update. Knowledge updates based on explicit instructions tend to\nperform well on Natural Language Understanding tasks but are limited to simpler instructions and struggle with tasks\ndiverging from evaluation sets. Improving adaptability to diverse tasks often incurs catastrophic forgetting. A crucial\nManuscript submitted to ACM\nDomain Specialization as the Key to Make Large Language Models Disruptive: A Comprehensive Survey 23\nquestion is extending model knowledge and abilities without causing such forgetting. Recently, Huang et al. proposed a\nmethod that uses a pre-trained LLM to generate high-confidence, rationale-augmented answers for unlabeled questions,\nimproving general reasoning without ground truth labels or explicit instructions [ 55]. Additionally, Scialom et al. are\nexpanding LLM knowledge and abilities without forgetting previous skills by fine-tuning LLMs across various tasks\nand introducing an approach to counter catastrophic forgetting with Continual Learning via Rehearsal [138, 141].\n5.2.2 Partial Knowledge Update. Other than leveraging task-specific instructions to fine-tune LLMs, a number of\napproaches emerge to conduct LLM fine-tuning by updating/editing a part of LLM parameters that link to specific\nknowledge without leveraging external guidance. Suppose 𝑓Θ(·)denotes the function of LLM parametrized with the set\nof parameters Θand𝜃∈Θis the single parameter in Θ. Updating the inner knowledge of 𝑓Θ(·)based on a collection of\ntraining data 𝐷is denoted as:\n˜Θ=Θ+∇𝑓Θ(𝐷)⊙𝑇, 𝑇(𝑖)= \n1,if𝜃(𝑖)∈Θ𝑇\n0,if𝜃(𝑖)∉Θ𝑇(1)\nwhere𝑇denotes the mask vector and 𝑇(𝑖)∈𝑇denote the𝑖-th element of 𝑇. The mask controls the amount of LLM’s\ninner knowledge to be updated in each fine-tuning iteration, where we use Θ𝑇⊆Θto denote the parameters that need\nto be updated in Θ. In the conventional setting of fine-tuning pre-trained language models [ 50,130,189],|Θ|=|Θ𝑇|.\nHowever, updating all of the parameters is computationally prohibited and resource-consuming in the context of LLM.\nEmpirically,|Θ|≫|Θ𝑇|, which refers to the modification of only a small number of parameters. Existing parameter-\nefficient knowledge update can be categorized into three streams: i.e., Knowledge Editing aims at directly locating\nand updating a small subset of parameters in an LLM; Gradient Masking aims at masking out the gradients of\nnon-relative parameters during the fine-tuning; and Knowledge Distillation focuses on obtaining a child model with\ndomain-specific knowledge from LLMs.\nKnowledge Editing. Recent research has seen success in updating LLMs with new memories to replace outdated\ninformation or add specialized domain knowledge. For instance, improving the ability to update an outdated prediction\nlike “Boris Johnson is Prime Minister of the UK\" can enhance an LLM’s reliability and generalization. Various methods\nhave been proposed to locate and edit an LLM’s parametric knowledge [ 25,28,48,95,96]. De Cao et al. proposed a\nhyper-network trained to update LLM parameters with a single fact needing modification, avoiding fine-tuning to\nprevent performance degeneration [ 28]. However, later works found that hyper-network-based editing falters as the\nLLM scales up, proposing retrieval-based methods to store edits in explicit memory and reason over them to adjust LLM\npredictions [ 103,104]. Other methods focus on localizing and understanding LLM internal mechanisms. Notable works\nidentify crucial neuron activations for LLM factual predictions through attention mechanisms and causal interventions,\nsuccessfully updating domain facts [ 25,95,96]. A recent method is proposed learning a map from textual queries to\nfact encodings in an LLM’s internal representation, using these encodings as knowledge editors and probes [48].\nGradient Masking. Gradient masking is a technique used to selectively update specific parts of an LLM during\nthe fine-tuning process. The main goal is to reduce computational overhead and potentially mitigate issues such as\ncatastrophic forgetting or overfitting, particularly when adapting pre-trained models to smaller or specialized datasets.\nGradient masking involves modifying the gradients during back-propagation by applying a masking function (Equation\n(1)). This function determines which parts of the model will be updated, effectively masking the gradients for certain\nManuscript submitted to ACM\n24 Ling, et al.\nparameters and keeping them unchanged. The choice of parameters to mask can be based on various criteria, such as\ntheir relevance to the task, importance in the model, or contribution to the overall loss.\nEarlier attempts [ 62,178] have been made to efficiently fine-tune relatively small language models by utilizing\nvarious regularization techniques, their methods cannot easily adapt to fine-tuning LLMs. This is primarily due to the\nsubstantially larger amounts of data and computational resources required to train LLMs effectively, which can be\nseveral orders of magnitude more than what is needed for smaller language models. To add gradient masks to LLMs,\nCHILD-TUNING [ 171] utilizes the downstream task data to detect the most task-related parameters as the child network\nand freezes the parameters in non-child network to their pre-trained weights. Moreover, Zhang et al. [ 181] propose a\nDynamic Parameter Selection algorithm for efficiently fine-tuning LLMs, which adaptively selects a more promising\nsub-network to perform staging updates based on gradients of back-propagation, which brings great improvement in\ndomain-specific downstream tasks under low-resource scenarios.\nKnowledge Distillation. While most works on LLM self-knowledge update focus on task-specific instructions and\nparameter efficiency, a promising area of research explores distilling domain-specific knowledge from LLMs into smaller\nnetworks to reduce inference latency and enhance domain-specific task solving ability. Muhamed et al. compressed a 1.5\nbillion parameter LLM to a 70 million parameter model for Click-through-rate prediction, introducing twin-structured\nBERT-like encoders and a fusion layer for a cross-architecture distillation from a single LLM, resulting in superior\nperformance in both online and offline settings [ 106]. Similarly, [ 4,94,154] employ a knowledge distillation module\nfor LLM fine-tuning, achieving faster convergence and better resource utilization. This module leverages pre-trained\nparameters for quick convergence and trains a small subset of parameters to address model over-parameterization.\nFurthermore, [ 51,142] distill the step-by-step chain-of-thought reasoning abilities of larger models into smaller models.\n5.2.3 Open Challenges. Fine-tuning LLMs with the latest data ensures that they provide relevant and accurate informa-\ntion, especially in domains where rapid changes occur, such as technology, medicine, and current events. Furthermore,\nwe have observed different applications or users may have unique requirements or preferences. However, fine-tuning\nthe large-scale LLMs also poses several open challenges:\n(1)Compliance with regulations : In most cases, updating and fine-tuning LLMs are necessary to ensure compliance\nwith specific regulations or guidelines, such as data protection laws or industry-specific requirements. The\nso-called LLM alignment can be accomplished during the fine-tuning phase.\n(2)Computational resources : Fine-tuning or updating inner knowledge of LLMs necessitates access to high-performance\nGPUs or specialized hardware, which can be expensive and difficult to obtain, particularly for individual re-\nsearchers or smaller organizations. Pursuing fine-tuning efficiency is still a practical yet essential problem.\n6 APPLICATIONS OF LLM DOMAIN SPECIALIZATION\nIn this survey paper, we explore the applications of LLMs across a range of domain-specific tasks in social sciences (e.g.,\neducation, finance, law), natural sciences (e.g., biomedicine, earth science), and formal sciences (e.g., human-computer\ninteraction, software engineering, and cyber security). To achieve domain specialization for LLMs in these diverse\nfields, readers can employ various techniques, such as external augmentation, instruction crafting, and knowledge\nupdate. These approaches can help tailor LLMs to specific tasks and challenges in each domain, enabling more accurate,\nrelevant, and effective applications. Although each domain has its unique challenges and requirements, several common\napplications of specialized LLMs are shared across these fields:\nManuscript submitted to ACM\nDomain Specialization as the Key to Make Large Language Models Disruptive: A Comprehensive Survey 25\n•Advanced information extraction : They can identify entities, relationships, and events from domain-specific texts,\nsuch as recognizing genes in biomedical literature or detecting legal clauses in contracts.\n•Text generation and summarization : They can generate high-quality, domain-specific content and create accurate\nsummaries of complex domain-specific texts.\n•Data-driven predictions and recommendations : They can analyze domain-specific data for forecasting and providing\nrecommendations, like predicting financial trends or suggesting personalized medical treatment plans.\n•Conversational agents and expert systems : They can be incorporated into conversational agents or expert systems\nfor domain-specific guidance, such as virtual tutors or legal chatbots.\n•Automated code generation and analysis : In software engineering, they can generate or analyze code, identify\nbugs, or suggest improvements based on natural language descriptions.\nIn this section, we dive deep to review existing techniques for specializing LLMs in domain-specific tasks and discuss\npotential open challenges in detail. Due to the space limitation, we only provide a brief introduction of each domain\nand leave the complete discussion in the supplementary material.\nBiomedicine. Language models are becoming increasingly useful in the field of biology, from fundamental biomedical\nresearch [ 91,132] to clinical healthcare support [ 58,105,127]. At the fundamental biomedicine science level, LLMs can\nbe trained on vast amounts of domain-specializing data (e.g., genomic and proteomic) to analyze and predict biological\nfunctions, disease mechanisms, and drug discovery. LLMs can also aid in predicting protein structures and interactions,\nwhich are critical for understanding cellular processes and designing new drugs. At the clinical healthcare support level,\npre-trained or medical corpus fine-tuned LLMs can be used for the natural language processing of medical records\nto identify patterns, make diagnoses, and provide personalized treatment recommendations. Also, LLMs can assist in\nmedical image analysis in a multi-modality learning way, such as identifying specific features in X-rays or MRI scans.\nOverall, LLMs offer tremendous potential for advancing biology research and improving healthcare outcomes.\nEarth Science. Earth science is an interdisciplinary domain focused on examining the interactions between physical\nand human systems across diverse spatial and temporal scales. This field incorporates methods from Earth observation,\ninformation science, spatial analysis, complexity theory, and simulation modeling to investigate phenomena like\nclimate change, land-use change, natural disasters, environmental development, and urbanization. Spatial information\nis vital to Earth science, and geographic information science tools are invaluable for a wide range of interdisciplinary\nstudies involving spatial data. Large language models like ChatGPT can act as question-answer systems, assisting those\ninterested in Earth Science to gain pertinent knowledge, such as recommending the optimal earth observation dataset\nfor specific research purposes, offering code examples like Google Earth Engine code for processing satellite data,\nproviding high-quality responses to environmental-related questions [ 188], developing innovative idea [ 9], generating\nclimate scenario [ 9]. LLMs can also be tailored to various Earth Science-related downstream tasks through methods\nsuch as fine-tuning, few-shot, or even zero-shot learning.\nFinance and Law. Specializing LLMs in the financial and legal domains requires careful adaptation to the distinctive\ncharacteristics of these fields. In the financial domain [ 71,87,169,174], models need to comprehend complex financial\nterminologies, economic trends, and regulatory norms to accurately generate content like financial reports, investment\nanalyses, or risk assessments. Meanwhile, the legal domain [ 15,120,151] demands understanding and generation of\nintricate legal language, comprehension of laws, legal codes, and court rulings, while maintaining absolute precision\nand a xxformal tone. For both domains, model specialization often involves fine-tuning with domain-specific datasets,\nManuscript submitted to ACM\n26 Ling, et al.\nincorporating explicit domain knowledge, and optimizing for domain-specific objectives like compliance with regulations,\naccuracy of information, or effectiveness of advice. However, it’s crucial to maintain an ethical guardrail for these\nmodels, given the high stakes nature of both financial and legal decisions. The specialized models also need to keep\nabreast of the evolving landscapes of these domains, adapting to changes in laws, regulations, or financial trends.\nHuman Computer Interaction and Software Engineering. Specializing LLMs in the domains of human-computer\ninteraction (HCI) and software engineering requires a deep understanding of the terminologies, workflows, and\nconventions unique to these areas. In the HCI domain, an LLM may be specialized to understand and respond to user\ninputs more effectively, potentially improving the design and usability of interfaces by offering more natural and\nintuitive interaction paradigms. This involves training the model on diverse data, ranging from human conversational\ndata to user interaction logs. On the other hand, in the software engineering domain, an LLM can be specialized to aid\nin tasks such as code generation, bug detection, code review, and documentation. This involves training the model on\nlarge codebases, issue trackers, documentation, and other software-related data. These specialized models can provide\nvaluable assistance to developers, enhance the software development process, and potentially revolutionize the way we\ninteract with computers. Despite the promising applications, several challenges remain, including the complexity of\nthese domains, the need for accurate and up-to-date data, and the balance between specialized and general knowledge.\n7 OPEN CHALLENGES AND FUTURE WORKS\n7.1 Open Challenges\nAfter having explored the current approaches for domain specialization of large language models, categorized as\nwhite box, grey box, and black box methods, it is essential to acknowledge that despite the significant progress in this\nfield, there remain several open challenges. These challenges pervade all categories of models, irrespective of their\naccessibility or the specific techniques employed for specialization. As we strive to create LLMs that can effectively\nunderstand and generate domain-specific content, it is these challenges that will shape the future trajectory of research\nin this field. Let us delve into these open challenges to better comprehend the complexities of domain specialization\nand the areas where further research is required.\n•Domain Complexity : Each domain has its unique intricacies and complexities, which could range from highly\nspecialized vocabularies, and nuanced terminologies to complex knowledge structures. For instance, the legal or\nmedical field employs language and terms that are extremely domain-specific and follow certain syntax and\nstructure rules. This complexity extends to the relationships between different entities and concepts within the\ndomain. Accurately understanding and modeling this intricate domain knowledge is a significant challenge for\nall types of models.\n•Balancing General and Domain Knowledge : An LLM, while needing to understand the specificities of a particular\ndomain, also has to maintain its general knowledge to provide contextually appropriate responses. If a model is\noverly specialized, it may perform exceptionally within the targeted domain but fail to understand or generate\ncoherent responses to prompts outside of it. Conversely, retaining too much general knowledge may dilute the\ndomain-specific responses. Striking this balance between general and domain knowledge is a complex task.\n•Explainability and Trust : As LLMs become more sophisticated, their decision-making process also becomes more\nopaque, raising the challenge of explainability. It is crucial for users, especially in high-stakes domains like\nhealthcare, law, or finance, to understand how the model arrived at a certain output. Achieving this transparency\nManuscript submitted to ACM\nDomain Specialization as the Key to Make Large Language Models Disruptive: A Comprehensive Survey 27\ncan help build trust in the system. The challenge lies in the trade-off between model complexity and explainability,\nas increasing one often decreases the other.\n•Adapting to Domain Evolution : Domains are not static; they evolve over time with the introduction of new\nterminologies, concepts, and trends. For example, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic introduced a slew of new\nmedical terms and concepts. Therefore, an LLM that is specialized for a certain domain must continuously adapt\nto these changes to stay relevant and effective. Designing models that can keep pace with the evolving landscape\nof their specialized domain is a challenging task.\n•Scalability : Domain specialization often involves training or fine-tuning the LLM with domain-specific data,\ncrafting specific prompts, or using other domain-specific resources. While this might be feasible for a few domains,\nscaling this process to cover a wide range of domains or to handle large, complex domains is a significant challenge.\nIt involves not just computational resources but also the availability of domain-specific data and expertise. The\nchallenge is to create efficient and effective methods for domain specialization that can be scaled to cover many\ndifferent domains.\n7.2 Future Works\nAs we chart the frontier of large language model specialization, it’s not only crucial to build upon and refine the\nexisting black-box, grey-box, and white-box methods, but also to anticipate and explore innovative, out-of-the-box\ntechniques that have the potential to transcend these conventional approaches. Leveraging the rapid advancement\nof AI technologies and the increased understanding of LLMs, we can envision a future where novel techniques will\nemerge that push the boundaries of what’s possible in domain specialization, providing enhanced performance, greater\nflexibility, and more efficient utilization of resources.\n•Hybrid Approaches : This could involve combining multiple methods depending on the stage or specific needs.\nFor example, a model could start with a black-box approach, using external resources to augment input prompts,\nthen proceed to a grey-box method where gradients or loss values are used to further refine the prompts, and\nfinally employ a white-box approach to fine-tune the model based on the learned strategies and feedback. This\nhybrid approach could provide a balance between resource requirement and model performance and might be\nespecially effective when dealing with scarce domain-specific data.\n•Meta-Learning or AutoML Techniques : AutoML or meta-learning strategies could be used to automate the process\nof selecting the best strategies for domain specialization. For instance, a meta-learning approach might learn\na policy to select the best data for fine-tuning, the best prompt engineering techniques, or the best layers to\nfine-tune for a given domain, based on previous experience with similar domains. This could significantly reduce\nthe resources and expertise needed for domain specialization, and could potentially lead to more effective and\nefficient methods.\n•Incorporating More Explicit World Knowledge : Instead of relying solely on text-based pre-training, future LLMs\nmight leverage structured knowledge sources, like knowledge graphs, to augment their understanding of the\ndomain. This could involve techniques like graph neural networks or attention mechanisms that operate on\ngraph-structured data. For instance, a medical LLM could incorporate knowledge from a medical ontology graph\nto better understand the relationships between various medical terms and concepts. This could lead to more\naccurate and informative outputs, especially in domains where explicit structured knowledge is available.\nManuscript submitted to ACM\n28 Ling, et al.\n•Human-in-the-loop Learning : This involves continuous interaction and feedback from human users or experts to\nguide the model’s learning process. For instance, a legal LLM could be continuously updated based on feedback\nfrom legal professionals using the model. This feedback could be incorporated in the form of additional training\ndata, changes to the model’s reward function in a reinforcement learning framework, or modifications to the\nmodel’s prompts. This could lead to a more dynamic and adaptable model that can evolve with the needs and\nknowledge of the users.\n•Active Learning : This approach involves the model actively querying for information or feedback when it\nencounters a domain-specific concept it doesn’t understand or has low confidence about. For instance, if a\nmodel trained on general news articles encounters a specialized medical term it doesn’t understand, it could\nquery a medical ontology or ask for clarification from a human user. The model could then incorporate this new\ninformation into its subsequent responses. This could make the model more effective at handling unfamiliar\ndomain-specific topics, and could provide a more interactive and engaging user experience.\nEach of these techniques provides a promising direction for future research in the domain specialization of large\nlanguage models, and could help address some of the challenges and limitations of the current black-box, grey-box, and\nwhite-box methods.\n8 CONCLUSION\nIn conclusion, the rapid advancement of LLMs has sparked significant interest in harnessing their potential to tackle\ndomain-specific tasks in various natural, social, and formal science fields. However, several challenges, such as limited\ndomain-specific expertise, knowledge elicitation, and model complexity, hinder the direct application of LLMs in these\ndomains. This survey systematically categorizes and summarizes existing domain specialization techniques based\non their access level to LLMs, along with a comprehensive overview of application domains that can benefit from\nspecialized LLMs. By offering a detailed analysis of the advantages, disadvantages, and relationships among different\ntechniques and domains, this survey aims to assist domain experts in identifying suitable techniques for their target\nproblem settings, while also providing data scientists with a clear understanding of the practical significance and open\nchallenges in various application domains. Moreover, the paper highlights the current status of research in this area,\nshedding light on future trends and potential avenues for interdisciplinary collaboration. As the field of LLM domain\nspecialization continues to evolve, this survey serves as a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners, fostering\nfurther advancements and innovations in the application of artificial intelligence across diverse domains.\nREFERENCES\n[1]Zeyuan Allen-Zhu, Yuanzhi Li, and Zhao Song. 2019.

Introduction\nScalable sequence prediction models (Graves, 2014;\nVaswani et al., 2017; Child et al., 2019) have become a\ngeneral-purpose method for generation and representation\nlearning in many domains, including natural language pro-\ncessing (Mikolov et al., 2013; Sutskever et al., 2014; Dai &\nLe, 2015; Peters et al., 2018; Radford et al., 2018; Devlin\net al., 2018), computer vision (Van Oord et al., 2016; Menick\n& Kalchbrenner, 2018; Chen et al., 2020; Bao et al., 2021),\naudio and speech processing (Oord et al., 2016; 2018; Dhari-\nwal et al., 2020; Baevski et al., 2020), biology (Alley et al.,\n2019; Rives et al., 2021), and even across multiple modali-\nties (Das et al., 2017; Lu et al., 2019; Ramesh et al., 2021;\nZellers et al., 2021). More recently, language models have\nalso fueled progress towards the longstanding challenge\nof program synthesis (Simon, 1963; Manna & Waldinger,\n1971), spurred by the presence of code in large datasets\n(Husain et al., 2019; Gao et al., 2020) and the resulting pro-\ngramming capabilities of language models trained on these\ndatasets (Wang & Komatsuzaki, 2021). Popular language\nmodeling objectives like masked language modeling (Devlin\net al., 2018) and span prediction (Raffel et al., 2020) have\nalso been adapted to train their programming counterparts\nCodeBERT (Feng et al., 2020) and PyMT5 (Clement et al.,\n2020).\nSimilarly, our early investigation of GPT-3 (Brown et al.,\n2020) revealed that it could generate simple programs from\nPython docstrings. While rudimentary, this capability was\nexciting because GPT-3 was not explicitly trained for code\ngeneration. Given the considerable success of large lan-\nguage models in other modalities and the abundance of\npublicly available code, we hypothesized that a specialized\nGPT model, called Codex, could excel at a variety of coding\ntasks. This paper describes several early Codex models,\nwhose descendants power GitHub Copilot and the Codex\nmodels in the OpenAI API.arXiv:2107.03374v2  [cs.LG]  14 Jul 2021\nEvaluating Large Language Models Trained on Code\nFigure 1. Pass rates of our models on the HumanEval dataset as a\nfunction of model size. When a single sample is generated for each\nproblem, GPT-12B solves no problems, but Codex (ﬁne-tuned\non code) solves 28.8% of the problems, and Codex-S (further\nﬁne-tuned on correctly implemented standalone functions) solves\n37.7% of the problems. From here, further gains can be realized by\ngenerating 100 samples per problem and selecting the sample with\nthe highest mean log-probability (44.5% solved) or by selecting\nthe sample that passes the unit tests (77.5% solved). All samples\nare generated with temperature 0.8.\nIn this work, we focus on the task of generating stan-\ndalone Python functions from docstrings, and evaluate the\ncorrectness of code samples automatically through unit\ntests. This is in contrast to natural language generation,\nwhere samples are typically evaluated by heuristics or by\nhuman evaluators. To accurately benchmark our model,\nwe create a dataset of 164 original programming problems\nwith unit tests. These problems assess language compre-\nhension, algorithms, and simple mathematics, with some\ncomparable to simple software interview questions. We\nrelease this data along with an evaluation framework at\nhttps://www.github.com/openai/human-eval.\nTo solve a problem in our test set, we generate multiple\nsamples from the models, and check if any of them pass the\nunit tests. With just a single sample, a 12B parameter Codex\nsolves 28.8% of these problems, and a 300M parameter\nCodex solves 13.2% of these problems. In contrast, the 6B\nparameter GPT-J (Wang & Komatsuzaki, 2021) achieves\n11.4% on the same dataset, while all GPT models achieve\nnear 0%. To improve our model’s performance at the task of\nfunction synthesis from docstrings, we ﬁne-tune Codex on\nstandalone, correctly implemented functions. The resulting\nmodel, Codex-S, solves 37.7% of problems with a single\nsample. Figure 2 showcases problems of varying difﬁculty\nin our dataset, along with correct model generated solutions.\nReal-world programming tasks often involve iterations of\napproaches and bug ﬁxes, which is approximated by gener-\nating many samples from our models and selecting one that\npasses all unit tests. Within 100 samples, Codex-S is able togenerate at least one correct function for 77.5% of the prob-\nlems. This result suggests that accurate code samples can\nbe selected via heuristic ranking instead of fully evaluating\neach sample, the latter of which may not be possible or prac-\ntical in deployment. Indeed, we ﬁnd that the sample with\nhighest mean log-probability passes unit tests for 44.5% of\nthe problems.\nWe conclude by discussing the limitations and potential\nbroader impacts of these Codex models and of increasingly\npowerful code generating models more generally.\n2. Evaluation Framework\nIn this section, we discuss the details of our evaluation\nframework. We begin by deﬁning the pass@kmetric, and\nexplain its advantages over standard match-based metrics.\nNext, we describe the dataset of hand-written problems,\ncalled “HumanEval,” which we created in order to bench-\nmark our models. Finally, we discuss the sandbox environ-\nment we used to safely execute model-generated code.\n2.1. Functional Correctness\nGenerative models for code are predominantly benchmarked\nby matching samples against a reference solution, where\nthe match can be exact or fuzzy (as in BLEU score). How-\never, recent work has surfaced deﬁciencies in match-based\nmetrics for code. For instance, Ren et al. (2020) ﬁnds that\nBLEU has problems capturing semantic features speciﬁc\nto code, and suggests several semantic modiﬁcations to the\nscore.\nMore fundamentally, match-based metrics are unable to ac-\ncount for the large and complex space of programs function-\nally equivalent to a reference solution. As a consequence,\nrecent works in unsupervised code translation (Lachaux\net al., 2020) and pseudocode-to-code translation (Kulal et al.,\n2019) have turned to functional correctness instead, where\na sample is considered correct if it passes a set of unit tests.\nWe argue that this metric should be applied to docstring-\nconditional code generation as well.\nPerhaps the most convincing reason to evaluate functional\ncorrectness is that it is used by human developers to judge\ncode. A framework known as test-driven development dic-\ntates that software requirements be converted into test cases\nbefore any implementation begins, and success is deﬁned\nby a program that passes these tests. While few organiza-\ntions employ full test-driven development, integration of\nnew code is usually dependent on creating and passing unit\ntests.\nKulal et al. (2019) evaluate functional correctness using\nthe pass@kmetric, where kcode samples are generated\nper problem, a problem is considered solved if any sample\nEvaluating Large Language Models Trained on Code\nFigure 2. Three example problems from the HumanEval dataset, where the probabilities that a single sample from Codex-12B passes unit\ntests are 0.9, 0.17, and 0.005. The prompt provided to the model is shown with a white background, and a successful model-generated\ncompletion is shown in a yellow background. Though not a guarantee for problem novelty, all problems were hand-written and not\nprogrammatically copied from existing sources. Random problems and samples can be found in Appendix B.\npasses the unit tests, and the total fraction of problems\nsolved is reported. However, computing pass@ kin this\nway can have high variance. Instead, to evaluate pass@ k,\nwe generate n\u0015ksamples per task (in this paper, we\nusen= 200 andk\u0014100), count the number of correct\nsamplesc\u0014nwhich pass unit tests, and calculate the\nunbiased estimator\npass@k:=E\nProblems\"\n1nc\nk\u0001\nn\nk\u0001#\n(1)\nCalculating this estimator directly results in very large num-\nbers and numerical instability. In Figure 3, we include a\nnumerically stable numpy implementation that simpliﬁes\nthe expression and evaluates the product term-by-term. One\nmay be tempted to estimate pass@ kwith1(1^p)kwhere\n^pis the empirical estimate of pass@1, but we show that it is\nbiased in Appendix A.def pass_at_k(n, c, k):\n\"\"\"\n:param n: total number of samples\n:param c: number of correct samples\n:param k: k in pass@$k$\n\"\"\"\nifn - c < k: return 1.0\nreturn 1.0 - np.prod(1.0 - k /\nnp.arange(n - c + 1, n + 1))\nFigure 3. A numerically stable script for calculating an unbiased\nestimate of pass@ k.\nLater, we provide evidence that BLEU score may not be\na reliable indicator of functional correctness by showing\nthat functionally inequivalent programs generated by our\nmodel (which are guaranteed to disagree with the reference\nsolution on some input) often have higher BLEU scores than\nfunctionally equivalent ones.\nEvaluating Large Language Models Trained on Code\n2.2. HumanEval: Hand-Written Evaluation Set\nWe evaluate functional correctness on a set of 164 hand-\nwritten programming problems, which we call the Hu-\nmanEval dataset. Each problem includes a function sig-\nnature, docstring, body, and several unit tests, with an av-\nerage of 7.7 tests per problem. It is important for these\ntasks to be hand-written, since our models are trained on a\nlarge fraction of GitHub, which already contains solutions\nto problems from a variety of sources. For example, there\nare more than ten public repositories containing solutions to\nCodeforces problems, which make up part of the recently\nproposed APPS dataset (Hendrycks et al., 2021).\nProgramming tasks in the HumanEval dataset assess lan-\nguage comprehension, reasoning, algorithms, and simple\nmathematics. We release the HumanEval dataset so that\nothers can evaluate functional correctness and measure the\nproblem-solving capabilities of their models. The dataset\ncan be found at https://www.github.com/openai/human-eval.\n2.3. Sandbox for Executing Generated Programs\nSince publicly available programs have unknown intent and\ngenerated programs are often incorrect, executing these\nprograms poses a security risk. Indeed, GitHub is known\nto contain malicious programs that alter or change their\nenvironments (Rokon et al., 2020).\nTherefore, we developed a sandbox environment to safely\nrun untrusted programs against unit tests. Our goals were to\nprevent these programs from modifying, gaining persistence\non, accessing sensitive resources on, or exﬁltrating data from\na host or network. Since OpenAI’s training infrastructure\nis built on Kubernetes and cloud services, we designed our\nsandbox to address the limitations of these environments\nwhile remaining idiomatic with their patterns of use.\nWe selected the gVisor container runtime (Lacasse, 2018)\nas the main host protection component. Since container\nruntimes like Docker can share host resources with contain-\ners, a malicious container could potentially compromise a\nhost. gVisor protects the host by emulating its resources to\nintroduce a security boundary between the host and its con-\ntainers. Network-adjacent hosts and services are protected\nby eBPF-based ﬁrewall rules that prevent inbound and out-\nbound connections except for those required for experiment\ncontrol.\n3. Code Fine-Tuning\nWe ﬁne-tune GPT models containing up to 12B parameters\non code to produce Codex. In contrast with GPT, Codex\ndisplays non-trivial performance on the HumanEval dataset.\nIn fact, Codex is able to solve the majority of the problems\nin HumanEval if we generate and evaluate 100 samples perproblem, and pick one that passes unit tests. When limited to\na budget of one evaluation per problem, producing multiple\nsamples with Codex and choosing the one with the highest\nmean log-probability provides signiﬁcant gains.\n3.1. Data Collection\nOur training dataset was collected in May 2020 from 54 mil-\nlion public software repositories hosted on GitHub, contain-\ning 179 GB of unique Python ﬁles under 1 MB. We ﬁltered\nout ﬁles which were likely auto-generated, had average line\nlength greater than 100, had maximum line length greater\nthan 1000, or contained a small percentage of alphanumeric\ncharacters. After ﬁltering, our ﬁnal dataset totaled 159 GB.\n3.2. Methods\nSince Codex is evaluated on natural language prompts, we\nhypothesized that it would be beneﬁcial to ﬁne-tune from\nthe GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) model family, which already\ncontains strong natural language representations. Surpris-\ningly, we did not observe improvements when starting from\na pre-trained language model, possibly because the ﬁne-\ntuning dataset is so large. Nevertheless, models ﬁne-tuned\nfrom GPT converge more quickly, so we apply this strategy\nfor all subsequent experiments.\nWe train Codex using the same learning rate as the corre-\nsponding GPT model, with a 175 step linear warmup and\ncosine learning rate decay. We train for a total of 100 billion\ntokens, using the Adam optimizer with \f1= 0:9,\f2= 0:95,\n\u000f= 108, and a weight decay coefﬁcient of 0:1.\nIn order to maximally leverage text representations from\nGPT, we base our code lexer on the GPT-3 text tokenizer.\nSince the distribution of words in GitHub code differs from\nthat of natural text, this tokenizer is not very effective for\nrepresenting code. The largest source of inefﬁciency arises\nfrom encoding whitespace, so we add an additional set of\ntokens for representing whitespace runs of different lengths.\nThis allows us to represent code using approximately 30%\nfewer tokens.\nTo compute pass@ k, we assemble each HumanEval prob-\nlem into a prompt consisting of a header, a signature, and\na docstring, which is illustrated in Figure 2. We sample\ntokens from Codex until we encounter one of the following\nstop sequences: ‘nnclass ’, ‘nndef ’, ‘nn#’, ‘nnif’, or\n‘nnprint ’, since the model will continue generating addi-\ntional functions or statements otherwise. We use nucleus\nsampling (Holtzman et al., 2020) with top p= 0:95for all\nsampling evaluation in this work.\n3.3. Results\nIn Figure 4, we plot test loss on a held-out validation set\nagainst Codex model size. We ﬁnd that just as language\nEvaluating Large Language Models Trained on Code\nFigure 4. Model cross-entropy test loss measured on a held-out\nsplit of our Python GitHub code corpus. The smooth power law\nscaling of performance with model size observed in GPT-3 appears\nto hold even after code ﬁne-tuning.\nmodel test loss follows a power law in model size (Kaplan\net al., 2020), test loss after code ﬁne-tuning follows a similar\npower law with functional form (N\n5:92\u0002107)0:13whereN\nis the number of non-embedding parameters in the model.\nWhen evaluating pass@ k, it is important to optimize sam-\npling temperature for the particular value of k. In Figure 5,\nwe plot pass@ kagainst the number of samples kand the\nsampling temperature. We ﬁnd that higher temperatures are\noptimal for larger k, because the resulting set of samples\nhas higher diversity, and the metric rewards only whether\nthe model generates any correct solution.\nIn particular, for a 679M parameter model, the optimal tem-\nperature for pass@1 is T\u0003= 0:2and the optimal tempera-\nture for pass@100 is T\u0003= 0:8. With these temperatures,\nwe ﬁnd that pass@1 and pass@100 scale smoothly as a\nfunction of model size (Figure 6).\nPass@kcan also be interpreted as the result of evaluating\nthe best out of ksamples, where the best sample is picked\nby an oracle with prior knowledge of the unit tests. From\na practical perspective, we are also interested in the set-\nting where we must select a single sample from ksamples\nwithout having access to an oracle. For instance, when the\nmodel is used as an autocomplete tool where a user provides\na prompt, we do not have unit tests, but would like to return\nonly a single completion to the user for evaluation so as to\nnot overwhelm them.\nInspired by similar work in language modeling, we ﬁnd\nthat choosing the sample with the highest mean token log\nprobability outperforms evaluating a random sample, while\nchoosing the sample based on sum log probability can per-\nform slightly worse than picking randomly. Figure 7 demon-\nstrates the beneﬁts of applying these heuristics to samples\n(at temperature 0.8) from Codex-12B.\nFigure 5. In the top panel, we plot pass@ kagainst the number of\nsamples ( k) for various temperature settings. Higher temperatures\nare better when the number of samples is large, likely due to the\nincreased sample diversity. In the bottom panel, we plot the best\ntemperature setting for each k, obtained by taking the upper hull\nof the top panel.\nFigure 6. Using the optimal temperatures 0.2 and 0.8 for pass@1\nand pass@100, we plot these two metrics as a function of model\nsize. Performance appears to scale smoothly as a sigmoid in log-\nparameters.\nEvaluating Large Language Models Trained on Code\nFigure 7. Model performance in the setting where we can generate\nmultiple samples, but only evaluate one. We can do better than ran-\ndomly selecting a sample by choosing the solution with the highest\nmean log-probability (red) or with the highest back-translation\nscore (orange) described in Sec. 5. The blue line represents the\ntheoretical best performance obtained using an oracle with prior\nknowledge of the unit tests.\nFinally, we compute BLEU scores for all Codex-12B Hu-\nmanEval samples (at temperature 0.8) against their reference\nsolutions. For each problem, when we plot the distributions\nof BLEU scores for correct and incorrect solutions, we\nnotice signiﬁcant overlap (Figure 8). Since an incorrect\nsolution is guaranteed to be functionally inequivalent to\nthe reference solution, we conclude that improvements in\nBLEU score may not indicate improved rates of functional\ncorrectness in practice.\n3.4. Comparative Analysis of Related Models and\nSystems\nTwo recent works similar in spirit to Codex are GPT-Neo\n(Black et al., 2021) and GPT-J (Wang & Komatsuzaki,\n2021), which are trained on The Pile (Gao et al., 2020),\na dataset containing text from a variety of sources as well\nas 8% GitHub code. The broader research community has\nfound that these models outperform existing GPT systems\nin qualitative programming evaluations (Woolf, 2021).\nWe conﬁrm these ﬁndings using the HumanEval dataset,\nshowing that GPT-Neo achieves 6.4% pass@1 and 21.3%\npass@100, while GPT models of comparable sizes achieve\nnear 0% on both metrics. We see a remarkable progression\nin capabilities, with GPT-Neo-2.7B roughly equivalent to\nCodex-85M ( 30\u0002fewer parameters). Similarly, GPT-J-6B\nachieves 11.6% pass@1 and 27.7% pass@100, which is\nroughly equivalent to Codex-300M ( 20\u0002fewer parameters).\nPass rates are obtained by taking the best result from eval-\nFigure 8. BLEU score probability densities for correct (blue) and\nwrong (green) solutions from Codex-12B for 4 random tasks from\nHumanEval.

Detailed results\nacross multiple model sizes can be found in Table 1.\nFinally, we benchmark Codex against the largest free model\nfrom Tabnine, a leading code autocomplete system, which\nachieves 2.6% pass@1 (at T= 0:4) and 7.6% pass@100\n(atT= 0:8). This is roughly equivalent to Codex-12M, one\nof the smallest models in our suite.\n3.5. Results on the APPS Dataset\nRecently, Hendrycks et al. (2021) introduced the APPS\ndataset to measure the coding challenge competence of lan-\nguage models. The APPS dataset consists of 5000 training\nand 5000 test examples of coding problems, each with a set\nof unit tests and, for the training data, a set of correct solu-\ntions. Most of the APPS tests problems are not formulated\nas single-function synthesis tasks, but rather as full-program\nsynthesis, reading input from stdin and printing output to\nstdout, in contrast to the main Codex training data.\nIn the paper that introduces APPS, the authors benchmark a\nfew language models and report two metrics: the percentage\nof problems where the model ﬁnds a correct solution (called\nthe “strict accuracy”) and the percentage of unit tests passed,\neven if the solution is incorrect. The latter measure is re-\nported only so as to reduce variance of the measurements,\nbecause the results on the ﬁrst metric were so low. We avoid\nthis metric and only focus on “strict accuracy”, and - as in\nEvaluating Large Language Models Trained on Code\nTable 1.

There are 2 additional factors, well-known\nfrom coding competitions, that we take into account:\n•In coding competitions and in the APPS datasets, tasks\nare provided with 3 input/output examples included in\nthe task description. We utilize this by sampling 1000\nsolutions from the model and ﬁltering out only those\nthat pass these 3 unit tests (if such solutions exist). We\nthen calculate pass rates in this ﬁltered set, and call it\nﬁltered pass@ k. Results without ﬁltering are presented\nas raw pass@ k.\n•It is often the case both in coding competitions and in\nthe results from Codex that a correct solution is found,\nbut it is not algorithmically efﬁcient enough to be con-\nsidered passing. While this is not acceptable in the\ncompetitions, we also report the number of solutions\nthat Codex produces that do not fail on any unit test,\nbut that do time-out on some of them. We use a timeout\nof 3 seconds in our evaluation.\nTo compensate for the fact the Codex is not ﬁne-tuned on\nAPPS, we append a single input/output example from the\ntask description to the docstring as a formatting hint. We de-\nnote this setting as “1-shot” in Table 2, and ﬁnd that Codex-\n12B evaluated 1-shot achieves comparable performance to a\nGPT-Neo model ﬁne-tuned on APPS. Consistent with our\nearlier ﬁndings, there are large beneﬁts from generating and\nevaluating as many as 1000 samples per task, though for\nmore difﬁcult problems, solutions are often not efﬁcient\nenough to pass the time limits. Finally, evaluating the ﬁrst\nsample which passes the 3 public unit tests for each problem\nyields higher performance than raw pass@100 samples.4. Supervised Fine-Tuning\nIn addition to standalone functions, Python code found on\nGitHub contains class implementations, conﬁguration ﬁles,\nscripts, and even ﬁles used to store data. This code is seem-\ningly unrelated to synthesizing functions from docstrings,\nand we hypothesize that the distribution mismatch reduces\nHumanEval performance.\nIn order to adapt Codex to the distribution of the task of in-\nterest, we construct a set of training problems from correctly\nimplemented standalone functions, and use them for addi-\ntional supervised ﬁne-tuning. We describe two approaches\nfor collecting these examples: from competitive program-\nming websites and from repositories with continuous inte-\ngration. We call the supervised ﬁne-tuned models Codex-S,\nand show that they produce consistent gains across model\nsize.\n4.1. Problems from Competitive Programming\nProgramming contest and interview preparation websites\nuse hidden unit tests to automatically judge the func-\ntional correctness of submissions. These problems are self-\ncontained, come with well-written problem statements, and\ngenerally have excellent test coverage. Additionally, these\nproblems test algorithmic reasoning over a broad range of\ncore skills and difﬁculties.\nWe collected problem statements, function signatures, and\nsolutions from several popular programming contest and\ninterview preparation websites. We then assembled these\ninto programming tasks similar to HumanEval, using the\nproblem description as the docstring. Since complete test\nsuites are often hidden, we created unit tests from examples\nfound in the problem statements, or extracted additional test\ncases through submitting incorrect solutions. In total, we\ncurated 10,000 problems in this way.\n4.2. Problems from Continuous Integration\nNext, we curated programming problems from open source\nprojects. Taking advantage of sys.setprofile , we\nwere able to trace and collect inputs and outputs for all\nfunctions called during integration tests. This data could\nthen be used to create unit tests for the functions.\nProjects that employ continuous integration (CI) are ideal\ncandidates for tracing. We follow the commands in the CI\nconﬁguration ﬁles, which contain build and test commands,\nto set up the virtual environments, install dependencies, and\nrun integration tests.\nWe considered GitHub repos using travis and tox as their CI\nframeworks, as they are two of the most popular CI tools.\nWe additionally used publicly available source code from\npip packages found in the python package index (PyPI).\nEvaluating Large Language Models Trained on Code\nTable 2. Finetuned GPT-Neo numbers from the APPS paper referenced above. For Codex-12B, the number of passing programs that\ntimeout on some test is in the bracket. We used temperature 0.6 for sampling to cover all kin pass@ k, so raw pass@1 results could be\nimproved with lower temperature.\nINTRODUCTORY INTERVIEW COMPETITION\nGPT-N EO2.7B RAW PASS @1 3.90% 0.57% 0.00%\nGPT-N EO2.7B RAW PASS @5 5.50% 0.80% 0.00%\n1-SHOT CODEX RAW PASS @1 4.14% (4.33%) 0.14% (0.30%) 0.02% (0.03%)\n1-SHOT CODEX RAW PASS @5 9.65% (10.05%) 0.51% (1.02%) 0.09% (0.16%)\n1-SHOT CODEX RAW PASS @100 20.20% (21.57%) 2.04% (3.99%) 1.05% (1.73%)\n1-SHOT CODEX RAW PASS @1000 25.02% (27.77%) 3.70% (7.94%) 3.23% (5.85%)\n1-SHOT CODEX FILTERED PASS @1 22.78% (25.10%) 2.64% (5.78%) 3.04% (5.25%)\n1-SHOT CODEX FILTERED PASS @5 24.52% (27.15%) 3.23% (7.13%) 3.08% (5.53%)\nBecause these projects contained untrusted code, it was im-\nportant to run integration tests in the sandboxed environment\ndescribed above.\nWhile there are millions of potential functions to curate\nproblems from, we only collected about 40,000 because\nnot all functions accept inputs and return outputs. Even\nwhen they do, most objects captured at runtime cannot be\npickled and restored outside the sandbox unless the project\nwas installed.\nSince our tracing methodology produced inputs and outputs\nfor all invoked functions, even builtin and library calls im-\nported by the project were turned into problems. For this\nreason, functions from tracing tended to be the building\nblocks of command-line utilities. To excel at these tasks,\nthe model does not need to know advanced algorithms and\ndata structures. Rather, it needs to be able to follow in-\nstructions to implement the functionality speciﬁed in the\ndocstring. Thus, tracing complements the puzzle nature of\ncoding competition problems and broadens the distribution\nof tasks.\n4.3. Filtering Problems\nIn the previous sections, we presented two methods we\nused to automatically create training problems. However,\nit is unclear how to control for quality. Some prompts\nunderspecify the function that is implemented, in which\ncase a perfectly valid solution may be wrongly penalized by\nthe unit test. Some problems are stateful, and subsequent\nexecutions can result in different outcomes.\nTo address these issues, we use Codex-12B to generate 100\nsamples per curated problem. If no samples pass the unit\ntests, we consider the task to be either ambiguous or too\ndifﬁcult, and ﬁlter it out. We reran this veriﬁcation several\ntimes to remove stateful or non-deterministic problems.4.4. Methods\nWe ﬁne-tune Codex on these training problems to produce a\nset of “supervised ﬁne-tuned” models, which we call Codex-\nS. To produce examples from training problems, we assem-\nble the problems into the format shown in Figure 2. If there\nare prompts of varying length in a batch, we left-pad shorter\nprompts to the length of the longest prompt, so that the ﬁrst\ntokens in the reference solutions line up in context.\nWe train to minimize negative log-likelihood of the reference\nsolution, and mask out loss for any tokens in the prompt.\nWe train using a learning rate 1=10as large as used for\nﬁne-tuning Codex, but adhere to the same learning rate\nschedule, and train until validation loss plateaus (less than\n10B tokens).\n4.5. Results\nAs with Codex, we ﬁrst compute the optimal temperature for\nevaluating pass@ kfor1\u0014k\u0014100. We ﬁnd that Codex-S\nprefers slightly higher temperatures for all k >1, which\npossibly reﬂects the fact that Codex-S captures a narrower\ndistribution than Codex. We use T\u0003= 0 for computing\npass@1 and T\u0003= 1for computing pass@100.\nNext, we compare Codex-S against Codex on pass@1 and\npass@100. Codex-S outperforms the corresponding Codex\nby an average margin of 6.5 percentage points on pass@1\nand by a larger average margin of 15.1 percentage points on\npass@100 across model size.\nWe also plot the performance of different sample selection\nheuristics for Codex-S-12B against the same heuristics for\nCodex-12B. When ranking between 1 and 100 samples\nby mean log probability, the average beneﬁt over random\nranking is 11.6 percentage points, which is over 2 percentage\npoints higher than the corresponding beneﬁt for Codex.\nEvaluating Large Language Models Trained on Code\nFigure 9. Optimal sampling temperatures as a function of the num-\nber of samples generated for both Codex and Codex-S. Codex-S\ngenerally requires a higher temperature for any particular value of\nk, possibly to compensate for the fact that it models a narrower\ndistribution.\nFigure 10. Comparing Codex-S against Codex on the metrics pro-\nposed in Section 3. Codex-S is one or two orders of magnitude\nmore parameter efﬁcient on pass@1 and pass@100, and log-prob\nsample ranking with Codex-S yields similar beneﬁts over random\nsampling that Codex does.5. Docstring Generation\nGenerating code from docstrings is possible with Codex\nbecause code typically follows after a docstring, but it is not\neasy to induce Codex to generate docstrings from code. Nev-\nertheless, we are motivated to produce a docstring writing\nmodel for safety reasons, as such a model can be used to de-\nscribe the intent behind generated code. Using the training\nproblems described in the previous section, we can eas-\nily create a training dataset for code-conditional docstring\ngeneration.\nSpeciﬁcally, for each training problem, we assemble a train-\ning example by concatenating the function signature, the\nreference solution, and then the docstring. Just as we train\nCodex-S by minimizing negative log-likelihood of the ref-\nerence solution, we train the docstring generating models\nCodex-D by minimizing negative log-likelihood of the doc-\nstring.\nWhen we benchmark our code generation models, we mea-\nsure pass@kon the HumanEval dataset, where correctness\nis deﬁned by passing a set of unit tests. However, there is\nno similar way to evaluate docstring samples automatically.\nTherefore, we grade sample docstrings by hand, considering\na docstring correct if it uniquely and accurately speciﬁes\nthe code body. Due to the time consuming nature of this\nprocess, we only grade 10 samples per problem, for a total\nof 1640 problems, from Codex-D-12B at temperature 0.8.\nCodex-D often generates incorrect unit tests along with a\ndocstring, but we ignore these during grading. However,\nwe do not consider the docstring correct when the model\nsimply copies the code body into the docstring. The most\ncommon failure modes we observe are when the docstring\nmodel leaves out an important detail (such as “an answer\nmust be to two decimal places”) or when it over-conditions\non the function name and invents a problem unrelated to the\nfunction body.\nAs shown in Table 3, pass rates for Codex-D are lower but\ncomparable to the corresponding pass rates for Codex-S at\nthe same temperature. We do not have a strong hypothesis\nfor which direction should yield higher pass rates. While\ngenerating docstrings may be more forgiving because natu-\nral language syntax is less strict than code syntax, docstrings\nin our dataset may be lower quality because developers tend\nto devote less time to writing docstrings. Indeed, our model\nproduces docstrings like “I just found this function online”\nand “This test is not correctly written and it’s not my solu-\ntion.”\nFinally, with a docstring model, we have yet another way\nto choose a single sample from a set of ksamples. In-\nstead of picking the sample with the best mean log proba-\nbility as investigated in the previous two sections, we can\nchoose the sample that maximizes the back-translation ob-\nEvaluating Large Language Models Trained on Code\nTable 3.

Unfortunately, in Figure 7,\nwe show that ranking samples via back-translation under-\nperforms mean log-probability ranking, though it outper-\nforms random ranking. This heuristic also appears to overﬁt\nquickly.\n6. Limitations\nWhile Codex is able to sample correct solutions for the\nmajority of HumanEval problems, we ﬁnd that it has a\nnumber of limitations.\nFirst, Codex is not sample efﬁcient to train. Our training\ndataset comprises a signiﬁcant fraction of publicly available\nPython code on GitHub, totaling hundreds of millions of\nlines of code. Even seasoned developers do not encounter\nanywhere near this amount of code over their careers. In-\ndeed, a strong student who completes an introductory com-\nputer science course is expected to be able to solve a larger\nfraction of problems than Codex-12B.\nNext, we explore prompts on which Codex is likely to fail\nor display counter-intuitive behavior. While evaluating code\ngeneration is well-studied (Xu et al., 2021; Helmuth & Spec-\ntor, 2015; Pantridge et al., 2017), many existing metrics\nmeasure performance in tightly speciﬁed, constrained prob-\nlem instances (e.g., string manipulation in FlashFill (Gul-\nwani, 2011)). Therefore, we developed a set of qualitative\nmetrics for measuring the capabilities of code generating\nmodels while controlling for the complexity and abstrac-\ntion level of the speciﬁcations (Appendix D). Applying this\nframework, we ﬁnd that Codex can recommend syntacti-\ncally incorrect or undeﬁned code, and can invoke functions,\nvariables, and attributes that are undeﬁned or outside the\nscope of the codebase. Moreover, Codex struggles to parse\nthrough increasingly long and higher-level or system-level\nspeciﬁcations.\nTo concretely illustrate model performance degradation as\ndocstring length increases, we create a dataset of synthetic\nproblems assembled from 13 basic building blocks, each of\nwhich modiﬁes an input string in a deterministic way. Ex-\nample building blocks are “convert the string to lowercase”\nor “remove every third character from the string” (the fulllist is described in Appendix C). We ﬁnd that as the number\nof chained building blocks in the docstring increases, model\nperformance decreases exponentially. This behavior is un-\ncharacteristic of a human programmer, who should be able\nto correctly implement a program for a chain of arbitrary\nlength if they can do so for a chain of length two.\nFigure 11. Pass rates of Codex-12B samples against the number of\nchained components in the synthetically generated docstring. With\neach additional component, pass rate drops by roughly a factor of\n2-3.\nFurther, just as text-conditional generative models in other\nmodalities (Ramesh et al., 2021) have difﬁculty with bind-\ning attributes to objects, Codex can make mistakes binding\noperations to variables, especially when the number of oper-\nations and variables in the docstring is large. For instance,\nin the following prompt, Codex-12B does not decrement the\nvariable w and also fails to return the product of all numbers.\ndef do_work(x, y, z, w):\n\"\"\" Add 3 to y, then subtract 4\nfrom both x and w. Return the\nproduct of the four numbers. \"\"\"\nt = y + 3\nu = x - 4\nv = z *w\nreturn v\nThis understanding of Codex’s limited system-level synthe-\nsis capabilities helps inform our assessment of the potential\nhazards of using it in a generative capacity, as well as the\nbroader societal impacts that such systems could have.\n7. Broader Impacts and Hazard Analysis\nCodex has the potential to be useful in a range of ways.\nFor example, it could help onboard users to new codebases,\nreduce context switching for experienced coders, enable\nnon-programmers to write speciﬁcations and have Codex\ndraft implementations, and aid in education and exploration.\nHowever, Codex also raises signiﬁcant safety challenges,\ndoes not always produce code that is aligned with user intent,\nEvaluating Large Language Models Trained on Code\nand has the potential to be misused.\nTo better understand some of the hazards of using Codex\nin a generative capacity, we conducted a hazard analysis\nfocused on identifying risk factors (Leveson, 2019) with\nthe potential to cause harm.1We outline some of our key\nﬁndings across several risk areas below.\nWhile some of our ﬁndings about the potential societal\nimpacts of code generation systems were informed by work\ntowards responsible deployment of the production-oriented\nCodex models (which descended from the research-oriented\nCodex models described in this paper), this section is not\nintended to provide a full account of any particular product’s\nsafety features. Unless otherwise speciﬁed, we anchor our\nanalysis in the speciﬁc properties of the models described\nin this paper. We share this analysis in the belief that some\nof it generalizes to the broader class of code generation\nsystems, and to encourage a norm of performing detailed\nimpact analysis as part of major machine learning research\nprojects.\nNote that by focusing largely on risks in this section, we do\nnot mean to imply that we expect the impact of this class of\ntechnologies to be net-negative; rather, risks merit particular\nattention here because they may be subtle or require deliber-\nate effort to address, whereas we expect the beneﬁts to be\nmore obvious and “automatic” from the perspective of most\nusers and affected stakeholders.\n7.1. Over-reliance\nOne of the key risks associated with using code generation\nmodels in practice is over-reliance on generated outputs.\nDue to the limitations described above as well as alignment\nissues described below, Codex may suggest solutions that\nsuperﬁcially appear correct but do not actually perform the\ntask the user intended. This could particularly affect novice\nprogrammers, and could have signiﬁcant safety implications\ndepending on the context. We discuss a related issue in\nAppendix G, namely that code generation models can sug-\ngest insecure code. For these reasons, human oversight and\nvigilance is required for safe use of code generation systems\nlike Codex.\nWe note several immediate ways to improve safety in the\nsubsection on risk mitigation below, though over-reliance\nin particular is one that we believe merits further inquiry\nin industry and academia. While it is conceptually straight-\n1We sought to include harms spanning geographic and temporal\nscales. We also considered not only the severity and probability,\nbut also the distribution of harms. However, we note that the\nanalysis described here is only one milestone in what we hope will\nbe a larger cross-sectoral and cross-organizational effort to steer\ncode generation in a societally beneﬁcial direction. As we describe\nour ﬁndings, we note various speciﬁc uncertainties and areas for\nfuture work in different sections.\nFigure 12. When the prompt includes subtle bugs, Codex tends to\nproduce worse code than it is capable of. This persists when the\nprompt also includes instructions to write correct code. This gap\nincreases with model size.\nforward to provide documentation to users reminding them\nabout model limitations, empirical investigation is neces-\nsary in order to identify how to reliably ensure vigilance in\npractice across a range of user experience levels, UI designs,\nand tasks. One challenge researchers should consider is that\nas capabilities improve, it may become increasingly difﬁcult\nto guard against “automation bias.”\n7.2. Misalignment\nAs with other large language models trained on a next-token\nprediction objective, Codex will generate code that is as sim-\nilar as possible to its training distribution. One consequence\nof this is that such models may do things that are unhelpful\nfor the user, despite having the capability to be more helpful\n(see Figure 12). For example, if the user has some subtle\nmistakes in their code, Codex may “deliberately” suggest\ncode that superﬁcially appears good but is incorrect.\nThis is an alignment failure - the model is not aligned with\nthe user’s intentions. Informally, a system is misaligned if\nthere’s some task X that we want it to do, and it is “capable”\nof doing X but “chooses” not to. In contrast, if a system\nfails to do X because it does not have the ability to do so,\nthen this system is not misaligned; it is just incompetent.\nSee Appendix E for more detail, including a more precise\ndeﬁnition of alignment.\nIt is important to study misalignment because it is a problem\nthat is likely to become worse, not better, as the capabili-\nties of our systems increase. For example, the model size\nscaling trend for the example in Figure 12 indicates that\nmisalignment would likely persist and even get worse if\ndata, parameters, and training time were scaled up.\nWhile we expect that misaligned behaviour like this is un-\nlikely to cause signiﬁcant harm in current models, it is likely\nto become more dangerous and harder to eliminate as model\nEvaluating Large Language Models Trained on Code\ncapabilities increase. A highly capable but sufﬁciently mis-\naligned model trained on user approval might produce ob-\nfuscated code that looks good to the user even on careful\ninspection, but in fact does something undesirable or even\nharmful.\n7.3. Bias and representation\nMirroring what has been found in the case of other language\nmodels trained on Internet data (Bender et al., 2021; Blod-\ngett et al., 2020; Abid et al., 2021; Brown et al., 2020), we\nfound that Codex can be prompted in ways that generate\nracist, denigratory, and otherwise harmful outputs as code\ncomments, meriting interventions such as those discussed\nin the subsection on risk mitigation below. We also found\nthat code generation models raise further bias and represen-\ntation issues beyond problematic natural language: Codex\ncan generate code with structure that reﬂects stereotypes\nabout gender, race, emotion, class, the structure of names,\nand other characteristics. Particularly in the context of users\nwho might over-rely on Codex or use it without ﬁrst think-\ning through project design, this issue could have signiﬁcant\nsafety implications, giving further motivation to discourage\nover-reliance. We discuss bias and representation issues\nfurther in Appendix F. Filtration or modulation of generated\noutputs, documentation, and other interventions may help\nto mitigate these risks.\n7.4. Economic and labor market impacts\nCode generation and associated capabilities have several\npossible economic and labor market impacts. While Codex\nat its current capability level may somewhat reduce the cost\nof producing software by increasing programmer produc-\ntivity, the size of this effect may be limited by the fact that\nengineers don’t spend their full day writing code (O*NET,\n2021). Other important tasks include conferring with col-\nleagues, writing design speciﬁcations, and upgrading ex-\nisting software stacks.2We also found that Codex imports\npackages at different rates, which could advantage some\npackage authors over others, particularly if programmers\nand engineers come to rely on Codex’s suggestions. Over a\nlonger time horizon, the effects of this class of technologies\non software-related labor markets and on the economy more\ngenerally could be more substantial as capabilities improve.\nMore study is needed both on the effects of code genera-\ntion capabilities and on appropriate responses. We discuss\neconomic and labor market implications in more detail in\nAppendix H.\n2Indeed, BLS classiﬁes computer programmers and software\ndevelopers separately, where developers are more highly paid than\nprogrammers, have more tasks indirectly related to writing and\ninteracting with code, and, in the US, are already projected to see\ngreater demand over the next 10 years (Li et al., 2020; Bureau of\nLabor Statistics, 2021a;b).7.5. Security implications\nCodex could have various effects on the security landscape.\nBecause Codex can produce vulnerable or misaligned code,3\nqualiﬁed operators should review its generations before ex-\necuting or trusting them, absent appropriate precautions.\nFuture code generation models may be able to be trained\nto produce more secure code than the average developer,\nthough that is far from certain.\nCodex could also be misused to aid cybercrime. Although\nthis is worthy of concern, based on our testing, we believe\nthat at their current level of capability, Codex models do\nnot materially lower the barrier to entry for malware devel-\nopment.4We expect that more powerful code generation\nmodels will lead to future advancements, and therefore fur-\nther research into mitigations and continued study of model\ncapabilities are necessary.\nThe non-deterministic nature of systems like Codex could\nenable more advanced malware. This non-determinism\nmakes it easier to create diverse software that accomplish\nthe same tasks. While software diversity can sometimes\naid defenders,5it presents unique challenges for traditional\nmalware detection and antivirus systems that rely on ﬁnger-\nprinting and signature-matching against previously sampled\nbinaries. For example, a more capable code generation\nmodel could conceivably advance techniques for generating\npolymorphic malware.6We believe that application secu-\nrity and model deployment strategies including rate-limiting\naccess and abuse monitoring can manage this threat in the\nnear term; however, the efﬁcacy of these mitigations may\nscale sublinearly as more capable models are developed.\nSimilar to large language models, Codex models can learn\npatterns present in their training data (Carlini et al., 2021).\nSensitive data present in source code are liable to be pre-\ndicted by the model. Because Codex is trained on public\nrepositories, we consider any sensitive data present in the\ntraining data to have already been compromised. Similarly,\nthe public data should generally be treated as untrusted, as\nprevious work (Goldblum et al., 2021; Schuster et al., 2020)\nhas found that attackers may be able to corrupt training data\nto trigger speciﬁc model behaviors at runtime. We further\ndiscuss security implications in Appendix G.\n3See Appendix G - Insecure Code for examples of Codex pro-\nducing insecure code.\n4For more on characterizing Codex’s capability limitations, see\nthe Limitations section and experiments in the security analysis in\nAppendix G.\n5For example, by helping to prevent certain types of memory\ncorruption vulnerabilities. See (Davis, 2018) for more.\n6Polymorphic malware is malicious code that mutates its im-\nplementation while maintaining its function.\nEvaluating Large Language Models Trained on Code\n7.6. Environmental impacts\nCodex, like other large generative models, has an energy\nfootprint from both training and inference (Schwartz et al.,\n2019; Bender et al., 2021; Patterson et al., 2021). The origi-\nnal training of GPT-3-12B consumed hundreds of petaﬂop/s-\ndays of compute, while ﬁne-tuning it to create Codex-12B\nconsumed a similar amount of compute. This training was\nperformed on a platform (Azure) that purchases carbon\ncredits and sources signiﬁcant amounts of renewable energy,\nreducing its carbon footprint.7Compute consumption also\nhas costs in the wider supply chain that can be quite con-\ncentrated on certain regions.8Looking more globally and\nlong-term, the compute demands of code generation could\ngrow to be much larger than Codex’s training if signiﬁcant\ninference is used to tackle challenging problems.9\n7.7. Legal implications\nThere are several legal considerations related to generated\ncode. To begin with, the training of AI systems on Internet\ndata, such as public GitHub repositories, has previously\nbeen identiﬁed as an instance of “fair use” (O’Keefe et al.,\n2019).\nOur preliminary research also ﬁnds that Codex models rarely\ngenerate code that is identical to the contents of training\ndata. Such occurrences were <0.1% in a study examining\nthe frequency of code generations that appear to match code\nsnippets in the training data (Ziegler, 2021). In these rare\ninstances, the generated code consisted of common expres-\nsions or conventions within the programming language that\nappeared over and over again in the training data. We ﬁnd\nthat, to the extent the generated code appears identical to\nthe training data, it is due to the predictive weightings in the\nmodel rather than retention and copying of speciﬁc code.\nGenerated code is also responsive and customized to the\nuser’s input, and the user retains complete control over\nediting and acceptance of the generated code. This can make\ncode generation similar to auto-suggest or auto-completion\n7Microsoft made a commitment in 2020 to shift to 100 per-\ncent renewable energy supply in its buildings and data centers\nby 2025. https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2020/01/16/microsoft-\nwill-be-carbon-negative-by-2030/ A full assessment of the envi-\nronmental impact of compute use is impossible to conduct without\ngrounding in context and making comparison to the counterfactual\nimpacts of competing products or services. Such analysis is out of\nscope for this paper.\n8While data center energy usage has become much more efﬁ-\ncient in recent years (Masanet et al., 2020), the production, use,\nand disposal of semiconductors still imposes environmental and\nhuman costs. See, e.g., (Crawford, 2021)\n9Given that code generation (and other forms of AI) might be\ndeployed widely throughout the economy as discussed above, these\nconsiderations suggest additional urgency in adopting renewable\nenergy.features that exist as features of other tools of authorship\n(e.g., document editors), in the sense that the ﬁnished work\nis still seen as the author’s.\nOur commitment to responsible and safe AI includes con-\ntinued attention to the broader intellectual property impli-\ncations of code generation systems. We intend to remain\nengaged with policymakers and experts on these issues so\nthat the users of such systems can ultimately deploy them\nwith conﬁdence.\n7.8. Risk mitigation\nIn closing, given the above, models like Codex should be\ndeveloped, used, and their capabilities explored carefully\nwith an eye towards maximizing their positive social im-\npacts and minimizing intentional or unintentional harms that\ntheir use might cause. A contextual approach is critical to\neffective hazard analysis and mitigation, though a few broad\ncategories of mitigations are important to consider in any\ndeployment of code generation models.\nCareful documentation and user interface design, code re-\nview requirements, and/or content controls (e.g., ﬁltering\nof outputs) may help to reduce harms associated with over-\nreliance as well as offensive content or insecure code gener-\nation. In the context of a model made available as a service\n(e.g., via an API), policies such as user review, use case\nrestrictions, monitoring, and/or rate limiting may also help\nto reduce harms associated with malicious use or prevent\nits use in high-stakes domains for which the models are not\nwell suited.\nAppendices E, F, G, and H provide further detail on the risks\ndescribed in this section and outline additional mitigation\nand research opportunities.\n8. Related Work\nThe deep learning resurgence has led to strong advances in\nthe ﬁeld of program learning. Two popular approaches to\nneural program learning are program induction and program\nsynthesis.\nIn program induction, a model generates program outputs\ndirectly from a latent program representation. Learning to\nExecute (Zaremba & Sutskever, 2014) demonstrated that\nmodels could execute simple tasks like addition and memo-\nrization. Later attempts at program induction incorporated\ninductive biases based on modern computing devices, such\nas the Neural Turing Machine (Graves et al., 2014), memory\nnetworks (Weston et al., 2015; Sukhbaatar et al., 2015), the\nNeural GPU (Kaiser & Sutskever, 2015), and the differen-\ntiable neural computer (Graves et al., 2016). More recent\napproaches like the Neural Program Interpreter (Reed &\nde Freitas, 2016; Shin et al., 2018; Pierrot et al., 2021) and\nEvaluating Large Language Models Trained on Code\nUniversal Transformer (Dehghani et al., 2019) found recur-\nrence to be a useful component in program induction.\nIn program synthesis, a model explicitly generates a pro-\ngram, usually from a natural language speciﬁcation. One\nof the most popular classical approaches used a probabilis-\ntic context free grammar (PCFG) to generate a program’s\nabstract syntax tree (AST). Maddison & Tarlow (2014) im-\nproved on this setup by learning a state vector used to con-\ndition child node expansion. Later, Allamanis et al. (2015)\napplied this idea in text-to-code retrieval and Yin & Neu-\nbig (2017) utilized it in text-conditional code generation.\nCode2seq (Alon et al., 2018) found that ASTs could also be\nleveraged for code-to-text generation.\nPrograms can also be synthesized without passing through\nan AST representation. Hindle et al. (2012) investigated\nn-gram language models of code, ﬁnding code to be more\npredictable than natural language. Latent Predictor Net-\nworks (Ling et al., 2016) showed that character-level lan-\nguage models could generate working code for implement-\ning Magic the Gathering cards in an online arena, when\naided with a latent mode that allows card attributes to be\ncopied into code. DeepCoder (Balog et al., 2017) trained\na model to predict the functions appearing in source code,\nwhich could be used to guide program search.\nFollowing the success of large natural language models (De-\nvlin et al., 2018; Radford et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2019; Raffel\net al., 2020; Brown et al., 2020) large scale Transformers\nhave also been applied towards program synthesis. Code-\nBERT (Feng et al., 2020) trained the BERT objective on\ndocstrings paired with functions, and obtained strong results\non code search. PyMT5 (Clement et al., 2020) is similar in\nspirit to our work, and used the T5 objective to train a sys-\ntem which can translate between non-overlapping subsets\noffsignature, docstring, body g.\nWe used functional correctness to benchmark our models,\nand observed improvements on this metric with more sam-\npling. SPoC (Kulal et al., 2019) considered the problem\nof producing functionally correct code from pseudocode\nwith a ﬁxed budget of compilations, which is similar to our\npass@kmetric. TransCoder (Lachaux et al., 2020) trained\na system to translate between programming languages in\nan unsupervised manner, and also observed that functional\ncorrectness better captured the capabilities of their model\nthan BLEU score. In fact, ContraCode (Jain et al., 2020)\nleveraged the large space of functionally correct programs\nto train a contrastive code model, which improved model\nperformance on tasks like type inference. Finally, Robust-\nFill (Devlin et al., 2017) observed that the best way to ﬁnd\na program consistent with input examples was to synthesize\nmultiple samples through beam search.\nTwo early domain-speciﬁc datasets used to benchmark neu-ral programming systems were FlashFill (Gulwani, 2011;\nGulwani et al., 2012) and Hearthstone (Ling et al., 2016),\nthough the community has trended towards broader and\nmore difﬁcult datasets. Barone & Sennrich (2017) proposed\na large training and evaluation dataset consisting of Python\ndeclarations, docstrings, and bodies scraped from GitHub.\nThe CodeSearchNet challenge (Husain et al., 2019) built\nan even larger corpus from GitHub with data from multiple\npopular programming languages. Recently, CodeXGLUE\n(Lu et al., 2021) aggregated several programming bench-\nmarks, making use of the recently proposed CodeBLEU\nmetric (Ren et al., 2020). Most relevant to our evaluation\nwork is the APPS (Hendrycks et al., 2021) benchmark for\nmeasuring functional correctness based on problems from\nthe competitive programming website Codeforces.\nFinally, we note that coding is a broad activity which in-\nvolves much more than synthesizing code from docstrings.\nTufano et al. (2020) use Transformers to generate unit tests\nfor code which outperformed commercial offerings. Aye\net al. (2021) built an internal auto-complete tool for Face-\nbook, and found that training on accepted user completions\nboosted system performance. Development also entails lo-\ncating and ﬁxing bugs. Early works used static or dynamic\ncode analysis (Agrawal et al., 1995; Korel & Rilling, 1997),\nlearned association rules (Jeffrey et al., 2009), and genetic\nprogramming (Goues et al., 2012) to debug faulty code.\nThese approaches relied on running against a test suite to\nnot only evaluate the correctness of suggestions but also\nexpose problems in execution trace or search for a solution.\nMore recent works (Tufano et al., 2019; Drain et al., 2021)\nconsidered bug-ﬁxing as neural machine translation from\nbuggy to correct programs. However, these works used an\nexact match against a reference instead of functional cor-\nrectness, citing Qi et al. (2015)’s ﬁnding that most of the\nproposed solutions by genetic search in (Goues et al., 2012)\npassed through weak test suites by deleting functionality\nthat failed. Human developers often write test suites with\nlimited but targeted coverage, but this does not always work\nwell against an algorithm, highlighting the challenges of\nevaluating correctness of programs.\n9. Conclusion\nWe investigated whether it was possible to train large lan-\nguage models to produce functionally correct code bodies\nfrom natural language docstrings. By ﬁne-tuning GPT on\ncode from GitHub, we found that our models displayed\nstrong performance on a dataset of human-written problems\nwith difﬁculty level comparable to easy interview problems.\nModel performance could be improved by training on a\ndistribution more similar to the evaluation set, and also by\nproducing multiple samples from a model. We also found\nthat it was simple to train a model to complete the reverse\nEvaluating Large Language Models Trained on Code\ntask of producing docstrings from code bodies, and that the\nperformance proﬁles of these models were similar. Finally,\nwe expanded on the broader impacts of code generating\nmodels, and discussed model limitations, ﬁnding signiﬁcant\nroom for improvement.\nAcknowledgements\nWe thank Sandhini Agarwal, Casey Chu, Jeffrey Ding, Pe-\nter Eckersley, Gillian Hadﬁeld, Rich Harang, Jacob Jack-\nson, Yunxin Jiao, Jade Leung, Andrew Lohn, Ryan Lowe,\nThomas McGuire, Margaret Mitchell, Florentine Eloundou\nNekoul, Cullen O’Keefe, Long Ouyang, Pranav Shyam,\nIrene Solaiman, Aravind Srinivas, Helen Toner, Ashish\nVaswani, and Jeffrey Wu for helpful discussions and feed-\nback on drafts of this work.

Estimating pass@ k\nWhile all estimators mentioned previously are consistent,\nonly the empirical estimate used by Kulal et al. (2019),\nand(1)are unbiased. Evaluating pass@ kin an unbiased\nway with any number of samples nis important for fair\ncomparison. For example, estimating pass@k= 1(1\npass@1 )kwith1(1^p)kusing the empirical pass@1,\nresults in a consistent underestimate as shown in Figure 13.\nThe gap doesn’t fully close even when n>5k, and results\ncan seem better with more samples. The interpretation of\nthis estimator is that we draw ksamples with replacement\nfrom a pool of ncandidates, but the ksamples are not\nindependent.\n(1)is unbiased, because it estimates the fail probability\n(1pass@1 )kas the probability of drawing kfailed samples\nwithout replacement. To show this, note that c, the number\nof correct samples that pass the unit tests, is distributed\nBinom (n;p), wherepis pass@1, and that (1)evaluates to 1\nwhennc<k . Then,\nFigure 13. Comparing the amount of bias and variance of two\nestimators of pass@ k. While the top expression may look correct,\nit underestimates the true value by a considerable margin. The\nunbiased estimator may have a slightly higher variance initially but\nallows for a fair comparison across different numbers of samples.\nEc\"\n1nc\nk\u0001\nn\nk\u0001#\n= 1Ec\"nc\nk\u0001\nn\nk\u0001#\n= 1nkX\ni=0ni\nk\u0001\nn\nk\u0001 \nn\ni!\npi(1p)ni\n= 1nkX\ni=0 \nnk\ni!\npi(1p)ni\n= 1(1p)knkX\ni=0 \nnk\ni!\npi(1p)nki\n= 1(1p)k:\nB.

Building Blocks for Synthetic Tasks\nWe describe the 13 building blocks used to create synthetic\ntasks for evaluating model performance as a function of\ndocstring complexity. Each building block is speciﬁed by a\nline of text and a line of code:\n1. “remove all instances of the letter e from the string”\ns = s.replace(\"e\", \"\")\n2.“replace all spaces with exclamation points in the\nstring”\ns = s.replace(\" \", \"!\")\n3. “convert the string s to lowercase”\ns = s.lower()\n4. “remove the ﬁrst and last two characters of the string”\ns = s[2:-2]\n5. “removes all vowels from the string”\ns = \"\".join(char for char insif\nchar not in \"aeiouAEIOU\")\n6. “remove every third character from the string”\ns = \"\".join(char for i, char in\nenumerate (s) ifi % 3 != 0)\n7.“drop the last half of the string, as computed by char-\nacters”\ns = s[: len(s) // 2]\n8. “replace spaces with triple spaces”\ns = s.replace(\" \", \" \")\n9. “reverse the order of words in the string”\ns = \" \".join(s.split()[::-1])\n10.“drop the ﬁrst half of the string, as computed by num-\nber of words”\ns = \" \".join(s.split()[ len(s.split\n()) // 2 :])\n11. “add the word apples after every word in the string”\ns = \" \".join(word + \" apples\" for\nword ins.split())\n12. “make every other character in the string uppercase”\ns = \"\".join(char.upper() ifi % 2\n== 0 else char for i, char in\nenumerate (s))\nEvaluating Large Language Models Trained on Code\n13.“delete all exclamation points, question marks, and\nperiods from the string”\ns = \"\".join([x for xinsifxnot\nin\".!?\"])\nThese building blocks can be easily composed by concate-\nnating their one-line descriptions into a docstring and by\nconcatenating their one-line implementations into a code\nbody. An example is shown below:\ndef string_manipulation(s: str):\n\"\"\"\nThis function takes a string as input, then returns\nthe result of performing\nthe following sequence of manipulations on that\nstring:\n-make every other character in the string uppercase\n-replace spaces with triple spaces\n\"\"\"\ns = \"\".join(char.upper() ifi % 2 == 0 else char\nfor i, char in enumerate (s))\ns = s.replace(\" \", \" \")\nreturn s\nD. Details of Speciﬁcation-based Evaluation\nFramework\nEvaluating the capabilities of code synthesis and generation\nis not a novel problem and has been explored in both the\nML (Xu et al., 2021) and synthesis (Helmuth & Spector,\n2015; Pantridge et al., 2017) communities. Previously, re-\nsearchers have recommended the use of existing metrics\nsuch as McCabe Cyclomatic Complexity (CC). That is, syn-\nthesis and generation metrics have largely concentrated on\nanalyzing the correctness and complexity of the code output\nrather than the expressivity and complexity of the speciﬁca-\ntion itself. Yet, evaluating the output of synthesized code\nis moot if there is no speciﬁcation that it can be measured\nagainst. Indeed, the synthesis and automatic programming\ncommunity (O’Neill & Spector, 2019) have recently called\nfor principled benchmarks and grand challenge problems to\nbe made in order to adopt a scientiﬁcally rigorous approach\nto compare synthesis methodologies against.\nIf we wish to understand the performance of generation\nand synthesis models relative to human ability, we should\nevaluate them against the complexity and expressivity of\nspeciﬁcation prompts, and assess their capability to under-\nstand and execute them. Given the ambiguity of natural lan-\nguage speciﬁcations, the challenge arises in how to deﬁne\nan appropriate set of benchmarks with increasingly complex\nand higher-level speciﬁcations to measure the capabilities\nof advancing code synthesis and generation methodologies\n(without the use of formal speciﬁcations themselves).\nWe thus propose adapting attributes used to measure the\nexpressivity and complexity of formal speciﬁcations to nat-\nural language prompts. This entails evaluating the ability\nto reason over computations and states at different levelsof abstractions (e.g., high-level requirements versus design-\nlevel requirements) as a base metric for complexity and\nexpressivity (e.g., variable dependencies, inter-procedural\nreasoning, computational interleavings, etc.). Below we\nprovide brief descriptions of such attributes and qualitative\nmetrics, which are to be further discussed in a forthcoming\npaper along with associated results for Codex models.\nWith regard to speciﬁcation abstractions, higher-level re-\nquirements or speciﬁcations are often distinct from lower-\nlevel speciﬁcations through the allocation of further struc-\nture and behavior within a deﬁned boundary to satisfy one\nor more higher-level requirements. That is, the lower-level\nthe speciﬁcation, the more well-deﬁned the architectural\nand programming constructs become. Indeed, there would\nbe more ambiguity and difﬁculty in deﬁning higher-level\nspeciﬁcations for code synthesis, as the algorithm would\nneed to implicitly derive an internal set of “lower-level”\nspeciﬁcations before synthesizing the corresponding code\nsolution. The degrees of separation between requirements\nand code would be greater, and would entail the synthesis\nof inter-procedural and architectural solutions across a large\nunconstrained space. However, if a lower-level speciﬁcation\nis provided with well-deﬁned constraints, this not only re-\nstricts the possible solutions, but also reduces the degrees of\nseparation between the speciﬁcation and the code required\nto be produced (e.g., to one function).\nThe current capabilities of synthesis methodologies are only\nable to tackle tightly speciﬁed, constrained problem in-\nstances or narrow tasks. However, Codex has demonstrated\npreliminary capabilities to consistently solve for high-level\nspeciﬁcations.\nBeyond the speciﬁcation abstraction level, language-\nindependent properties should be considered that would\nbe practiced by developers at various degrees of expertise\nand thus would implicitly be expressed in natural language\nprompts and speciﬁcations. These include:\n•Variable Interdependencies: Tracking state of more\nthan one variable, their interdependencies and nesting,\nall possible permutations of state, and the relationship\nbetween input and output parameters\n•Temporal Reasoning: as consideration of future and\npast program states including\n–Safety properties entailing that a deﬁned “bad”\nstate never occurs\n–Liveness properties entailing progress towards a\nspeciﬁc goal or state\n•Concurrency and Parallelism: Correct and sound\nreasoning over computational interleavings (for vari-\nous speciﬁcation granularities). The code generation\nEvaluating Large Language Models Trained on Code\ntechnique should be able to reason or synthesize solu-\ntions requiring properties such as:\n–Strong Fairness: every process that is inﬁnitely\noften enabled should be executed inﬁnitely often\nin a state where it is enabled\n–Weak Fairness: every process that is almost al-\nways enabled should be executed inﬁnitely often\n–Mutual exclusion, atomicity, and synchronization\n–Freedom from race conditions and data races\n•Hyperproperties (Clarkson et al., 2014): Information-\nﬂow policies and cryptographic algorithms requiring\nobservational determinism which requires programs to\nbehave as (deterministic) functions from low-security\ninputs to low-security outputs such as:\n–Noninterference : when the outputs observed by\nlow-security users are the same as they would\nbe in the absence of inputs submitted by high-\nsecurity users.\n•Nondeterminism: In computational theory, a nonde-\nterministic algorithm can provide different outputs for\nthe same input on different executions. Unlike a de-\nterministic algorithm which produces only a single\noutput for the same input even on different runs, a\nnon-deterministic algorithm travels in various routes\nto arrive at the different outcomes. A very simple and\ncommon example of this is a random number genera-\ntor10. A more advanced and extreme example is ML\nalgorithms themselves.\nAdditionally, we note to the reader that there are a number\nof speciﬁcation-independent coding practices that must be\nexhibited to achieve the aforementioned computational and\nstate reasoning attributes. Such attributes have long been\ndiscussed by the genetic programming community (Koza\net al., 1999), and we note the relevant properties to modern\nday synthesis techniques below:\n• Code and parameterized reuse\n• Automatic determination of program architecture\n• Wide range of programming constructs\n• Well-deﬁned\n• Wide applicability\n10A randomized algorithm is actually probabilistic Turing Ma-\nchine, but for practical intents and purpose it can be approximately\nconsidered non-deterministic given the determinism of real-world\nsystems (see (Barrington & Maciel, 2000))Note that many of the attributes and metrics deﬁned regard\nimplementation level design. Increasingly higher level spec-\niﬁcations should not need to specify which programming\nconstructs are required by implementation, and a code gen-\neration algorithm should be able to infer this instead. Indeed,\nsuch constructs are required by developers when solving for\nincreasingly complex and higher-level speciﬁcations. With-\nout them, it is unlikely that a code generation technique can\ntackle increasingly complex speciﬁcations describing and\nrequiring the computational and state reasoning attributes\nnoted.\nE. Analysis of Alignment Problems\nE.1. Why evaluate alignment?\nWe were interested in detecting problems with the Codex\nmodels that will not improve, or may even get more severe,\nas model capability improves. These are the problems that\nare likely to become most serious in the long term even if\nthey currently do not cause signiﬁcant harm.\nThe idea of “alignment” is intended to capture one set of\nproblems that have this property. In the literature, a model\nis deﬁned informally as “intent aligned” with a user if (and\nonly if) the model intends to do what the user wants (Chris-\ntiano, 2018; Kenton et al., 2021).\nIt is ambiguous how to apply this deﬁnition to Transformer\nmodels, since it is unclear to what extent they can be de-\nscribed as having “intent”, or what that intent would be.\nHowever, there is an intuitive notion that, given its training\nobjective, Codex is better described as “trying” to continue\nthe prompt by either matching or generalizing the training\ndistribution, than as “trying” to be helpful to the user.\nThis caches out in predictions that the model will complete\nconfused code with confused code, insecure code with in-\nsecure code (see G), or biased code with similarly biased\ncode (see F), regardless of the model’s capability to produce\nsecure, unbiased, and high-quality code. In fact, we would\nexpect that the model may “intentionally” introduce each of\nthese types of ﬂaws at some rate even when prompted with\nfairly good inputs.\nE.2. How can alignment be deﬁned and evaluated in\nmodels like Codex?\nDeﬁning alignment is complex, and there is not yet a sat-\nisfactory formalization. Without intending this to be the\nlast word on deﬁning alignment, we attempt to capture the\nintuitive idea described above in a way that can be measured\nexperimentally. We operationalize sufﬁcient conditions for\nintent misalignment for a generative model as follows:\n1.We consider a model capable of some task X if it has\nEvaluating Large Language Models Trained on Code\nFigure 14. When the prompt includes subtle bugs, Codex tends\nto produce worse code than it is capable of producing. This gap\nincreases with model size. Including an instruction to write correct\ncode helps a little but does not ﬁx the problem. Even with no\nexamples in the context, Codex produces signiﬁcantly worse code\nthan it is capable of.\nthe (possibly latent) capacity to perform task X. Some\nsufﬁcient conditions for the model being capable of X\nwould be:\n•It can be made to perform task X by prompt engi-\nneering, by ﬁne-tuning on a much smaller quan-\ntity of data than used in pre-training, by model\nsurgery, or some other technique which harnesses\ncapabilities latent in the model rather than adding\nnew capabilities; or\n•We can construct some other task Y , for which we\nknow the model needs to do X in order to solve Y ,\nand we observe that the model is capable of Y\n2.We say a model is intent misaligned if it outputs B, in\nsome case where the user would prefer it outputs A,\nand where the model is both:\n(a)capable of outputting A instead, and\n(b)capable of distinguishing between situations\nwhere the user wants it to do A and situations\nwhere the user wants it to do B11\nE.3. Results of alignment evaluations\nWe conducted several alignment evaluations. In the example\nevaluation shown in Figure 14, we deduce that the model is\ncapable of outputting code with a lower frequency of bugs,\nbased on the rate of bugs when prompted with high-quality\n11This deﬁnition has various problems and subtleties, which this\nmargin is too small to contain.code. We instruct the model to write correct code, and we\nassume the model could easily be ﬁne-tuned to detect such\nan instruction. This implies that the model is capable of\ndistinguishing between situations where the user does and\ndoes not want buggy code. We observe that in fact, it outputs\ncode with a higher frequency of bugs when prompted with\nbuggy code.\nBased on this we conclude that we have identiﬁed misalign-\nment in Codex models.\nThere are several subtleties here; probably the most im-\nportant one is distinguishing our observations from a ro-\nbustness failure. If the subtly buggy code is sufﬁciently\nout-of-distribution, we might observe that the model per-\nforms worse in these cases, simply because it is thrown off\nby the OOD input - it is not in fact capable of outputting\ngood code after seeing OOD prompts. We believe this is\nunlikely to be a large factor here, as the GitHub dataset\ncontains plenty of poor-quality code. The bugs are designed\nto be of the sort we’d expect to appear commonly in the\ndataset; code that compiles and often runs without errors\nbut gives an incorrect answer. Examples include off-by-one\nerrors or single-character typographic errors.\nE.4. Areas for Further Work\nWe hope that measuring (and improving) alignment will\nbecome standard practice for research on powerful ML mod-\nels. The datasets used for these evaluations are available at\nhttps://github.com/openai/code-align-evals-data.\nThere are many promising directions for improving align-\nment of current code-generation models, which also have\nthe potential to substantially boost models’ usefulness (Ken-\nton et al., 2021).\nOne starting point is to more carefully curate the pre-training\ndataset to remove buggy or insecure code. Another possi-\nbility is to label the pre-training data based on code quality,\nthen condition the model on the ’high quality’ label at de-\nployment time (Keskar et al., 2019).\nA common approach to adjusting the behavior of Trans-\nformers is to ﬁne-tune large pre-trained models with cu-\nrated or human-generated datasets of the desired behavior\n(e.g., Raffel et al. (2020); He et al. (2020)). In this case we\nmight want to ﬁne-tune on a dataset of high-quality, bug-free\ncode. However, it is notoriously difﬁcult for most humans\nto write bug-free code, so rather than acquiring this dataset\nthrough labeling it might need to be obtained by ﬁltering\ninput datasets using formal analysis or other metrics of code\nquality.\nA further possibility is RL from Human Feedback (RLHF),\nwhich has been successfully applied to language models to\nimprove alignment and consequently improve performance\nEvaluating Large Language Models Trained on Code\non downstream tasks (Stiennon et al., 2020).\nIn the context of code models, this would involve collect-\ning data from human labelers on whether generations were\ncorrect and helpful. Assisting human labelers with existing\nautomated testing and formal veriﬁcation tools, or even tools\nbuilt with the code-generating models themselves, may be\nuseful for providing a correct reward signal for RL or expert\niteration.\nFully aligning models on tasks that are hard for human la-\nbelers, especially if the models are more knowledgeable or\ncapable in some regards than their supervisors, is a challeng-\ning open research problem. Determining whether a model\nis fully aligned is also difﬁcult, and more work is needed\non metrics for alignment. Transparency tools that let us\nunderstand the model well enough to determine whether\nit is aligned, even if we are unable to evaluate alignment\npurely from input-output behaviour, are especially needed.\nAlthough it is challenging, successfully aligning Codex and\nsimilar models would likely be very useful. A fully-aligned\ncode-generating model would always write the best code\nit was capable of, refrain from ’deliberately’ introducing\nbugs, and follow the user’s instructions. This would be a\nsigniﬁcantly more helpful coding assistant.\nE.5. Experiment Details\nThe alignment evaluations are based on the HumanEval\ndataset described earlier in the paper: 158 problems with a\ndocstring describing the task, reference solution, and tests.\nWe took a subset of 30 eval problems,12and for each wrote\none solution with a subtle bug.\nWe construct prompts by prepending these solutions to the\ntask docstring prompts for the HumanEval task. We either\nprepend three examples of [docstring + correct solution], or\nthree examples of [docstring + solution with subtle bugs],\neach sampled i.i.d. from the 30 problems mentioned above\n(excluding the current task). We include examples where\nwe insert\n#instruction: write correct code even if\nthe previous code contains bugs\nbefore the start of the task docstring.\nWe then evaluate the performance of the Codex models on\nall 158 examples from the HumanEval dataset, comparing\nthe models’ performance on the prompts with correct so-\nlutions prepended, no solutions prepended, and prompts\nwith subtly buggy solutions prepended. We ensure that the\ncurrent task being evaluated never appears in the prompt.\nWe usedT= 0:2, following the evaluations in the main\npaper.\n12The ﬁrst 30 alphabetically by function nameThe datasets are available at https://github.com/openai/code-\nalign-evals-data.\nExample 1: sample prompt without bugs in context\ndef closest_integer(value):\n\"\"\"\nCreate a function that takes a value (string)\nrepresenting a number and returns the closest\ninteger to it.

Supplemental Bias Analysis\nGenerative models have been shown to encode bias in\nmodalities such as natural language (Brown et al., 2020;\nBlodgett et al., 2020) and images (Radford et al., 2021), and\nwe ﬁnd that the same is true of models like Codex that gener-\nate code. Given the ways and contexts in which code is used\nand reused, and the role code plays in laying the foundations\nfor world-changing applications, the generation of biased\ncode has the potential to cause allocative or representational\nharms, and to do so at scale.13\nWhile it can be tempting to think of code generation models\nas objective tools, we aim to demonstrate how they can be\nfar from that, and that the models can inherit the legacy of\noutdated and otherwise troublesome ideas. This is one key\nreason why code generated by the Codex models should be\ntreated as untrusted by those using it for research or devel-\nopment until they have reviewed and veriﬁed its accuracy\nand ﬁtness for purpose themselves.\nAs the research community explores more powerful code\n13Allocative harms occur when a system allocates or withholds\na certain opportunity or resource. Representational harms occur\nwhen systems reinforce the subordination of some groups along\nthe lines of identity, e.g. stereotyping or denigration (Crawford,\n2017).\nEvaluating Large Language Models Trained on Code\ngeneration tools that might be increasingly relied on, these\nissues become even more relevant and holistic assessment\nacross verticals such as bias becomes crucial for determining\nsafety for deployment. In this section, we discuss our probes\nfor bias in three areas: classiﬁcation completions in sensitive\ndomains; generated text such as comments or docstrings;\nand package import suggestions.\nNote that in this appendix, we explore the biases reﬂected\nin the ”unﬁltered” outputs of Codex models, which in turn\nwere built for research purposes. Thus, these results may\nnot all be representative of a production setting where miti-\ngations such as output ﬁlters or alignment techniques may\nbe applied.\nF.1. Probes for classiﬁcation prompts and completions\nthat encode bias\nIn order to better understand the potential that code genera-\ntion has to encode bias in the context of Codex in particular,\nwe developed a series of probes for instances of harmful\nbias in single- and multi-line autocompletions. We found\nthat, in response to simple prompts like def gender(x): , the\ngenerations often assumed binary gender for both single-\nand multi-line autocompletions.14When we probed us-\ning the prompt def race(x): , we found that many of the\nmost commonly-generated completions assumed a small\nnumber of mutually exclusive race categories. Most syn-\nthesized completions included “White” and many included\nonly a few other categories, followed by “other.” Several\nsynthesized generations included only 3 categories: “white,”\n“black,” or “none.”\nPrompts for probes related to classiﬁcation of protected\nclasses are often leading in their own right, and just as\nbuggy prompts result in buggy code, it’s likely that biased\nprompts or prompts for harmful behavior result in harmful\ncode. Thus more work is needed not just in correcting harm\nand bias in the model but potentially in training the model\nnot to respond to sensitive or context-dependent prompts.\nWe started with a handful of prompts related to gender that\nare themselves potentially “leading” of harmful behavior,\ntrying to gauge what the Python model had learned about\ncommon representations of gender in code.\nThese representations are learned not just from training data\nthat encodes social biases but also code written to process\n14There are fundamental issues with classiﬁcation of people into\ndiscrete gender and race categories, not least because neither can\nbe reduced to a set of discrete categories. Discrete categorization\nof people on the basis of race and gender usually elides important\nnuances in the diversity of human racial and gender identities.\nWe chose to begin with these classiﬁcation prompts in order to\nprobe whether the use of automated code generation could have\nthe potential to reinforce biased assumptions that might exacerbate\nthe harms potential of these tasks.and analyze datasets that encode classes in potentially harm-\nful ways.\nMore insidious are cases where the model may exacerbate\nharm or suggest harmful things in instances where an engi-\nneer was working on something else or didn’t necessarily un-\nderstand they were veering into harmful territory. For exam-\nple, in a few instances we began with classiﬁcation of “age”\nand, after suggesting code completions for classiﬁcation\nalong those lines, Codex went on to suggest classiﬁcations\nalong even more sensitive lines, including classiﬁcation of\n“emotion.”\nF.2. Analyzing bias in text generated by Codex\nIn addition to generating semantically meaningful source\ncode, Codex can also be used to produce text, e.g. in the\nform of comments or docstrings. Similar to language mod-\nels, Codex could be used in ways that denigrate groups\nor individuals. A priori, one might expect that ﬁne-tuning\non a dataset of code would decrease the extent to which\ncomments would produce blatantly prejudiced text, as code\ncomments are typically more neutral than the distribution of\ntext on the Internet.15On the other hand, it might be that the\nproduction of text in comments largely relies on Codex’s\npriors as a language model, resulting in little difference\nbetween Codex and GPT-3.\nTo test these hypotheses and the related harms, we com-\npared GPT-3 to Codex comment production on a series of\nco-occurrence tests across gender, race, and religion.16Very\nbroadly, we found that when explicitly prompted to talk\nabout speciﬁc genders, races, and religions, Codex com-\nments tend to reproduce similar biases to GPT-3, albeit with\nless diversity in the outputs. For example, with religion\n“Islam”, in both models we observed occurrences of the\nword “terrorist” and “violent” at a greater rate than with\nother groups, but GPT-3’s outputs included more variants\non these themes.\nThere are several caveats to this procedure. Co-occurrence\nis a blunt instrument, as it doesn’t pick up on the subtleties\nof how a particular word is used in context, only thatit is\nused in context. Additionally, since we are prompting both\nmodels to explicitly describe groups, they are not from the\nmodels talking about these group features in the wild, but\nrather in a constrained experimental setup.\n15To conﬁrm this intuition, we ran our co-occurrence evalu-\nations on the comments in our ﬁne-tuning GitHub dataset and\nfound that negative, occupation-related, and profane words did not\npreferentially occur in the presence of group words (race, gender,\nreligion).\n16Co-occurrence tests measure which words are likely to occur\nin the neighborhood of other words. We followed the same pro-\ncedure as the Fairness, Bias, and Representation analysis in the\nGPT-3 paper (Brown et al., 2020).\nEvaluating Large Language Models Trained on Code\nHow impactful are these textual harms? If it’s true that\ntext produced by Codex picks up Internet-scale biases like\nGPT-3, then one might expect the impact of these harms\nto be similar to GPT-3’s. However, this reasoning ignores\nthe likely use cases of the two systems. We’ve observed\nthat in typical use, Codex is less open-ended than GPT-3:\nthose who use it tend to prompt it in a more precise and\nneutral manner, though this is not always the case. Thus, we\ntentatively believe that the average case textual harms are\nlower in Codex, but the worst-case harms are likely similar\nto those of GPT-3. If this is the case, then it might be that\nthe textual harms in Codex are more naturally understood\nas a robustness issue: when the model is used to produce\ncomments in an out-of-distribution fashion, it tends to act\nlike GPT-3.\nG. Supplemental security analysis\nG.1. Threat actors\nThe threat landscape for Codex is similar to that of language\nmodels.17Actors can range from low and moderately skilled\nor resourced actors to well-resourced and highly-organized\n“advanced persistent threat” (APT) groups. Similarly, their\nstrategic objectives can non-exhaustively include making\nmoney, causing chaos, obtaining information, and/or achiev-\ning speciﬁc operational goals for their respective organiza-\ntions. However, the manner in which Codex models may be\nmisused will likely differ from that of language models.\nG.2. Potential misuse applications\nOne way to frame Codex’s capability is that Codex ex-\ncels in its ability to write boilerplate.18In the near-term,\nthreat actors may be interested in utilizing Codex or similar\nfamilies of models to assist in the production of malware,\nfacilitating phishing, or for other unauthorized offensive pur-\nposes. However, it is our assessment that Codex models do\nnot differentially enable offensive cybersecurity capabilities\nbecause they are not more efﬁcient or effective than conven-\ntional tools or techniques are. One possible exception to\nthis is the development of polymorphic malware, which is\ndiscussed in 7.5. We discuss additional investigations into\nCodex’s ability to aid malicious use-cases in the next few\nparagraphs.\nWe conducted experiments on Codex’s ability to generate\nmalicious code. While we found that while Codex is not\nproﬁcient at generating standalone malicious code, it is\nstill capable of generating code that can be incorporated as\ncomponents of more complex systems. For example, while\n17See the threat analysis in Section 6.1 of (Brown et al., 2020)\n18By boilerplate, we mean code that takes a small amount of\ncognitive effort for experienced engineers to write, but is a step\nbeyond simply copy-pasting code snippetswe found that the model struggled with generating SQL and\nshell injection payloads, it had no problem generating code\nfor recursively encrypting ﬁles in a directory.19\nWe experimented with applying Codex models to vulnera-\nbility discovery. While vulnerability discovery capabilities\nhave defensive applications, they are also potential misuse\nvectors because discovery is a precursor to exploitation. We\nfound that Codex did not perform well when compared even\nto rudimentary Static Application Security Testing (SAST)\ntools. These tools generally excel at ﬁnding simple vul-\nnerabilities that can be identiﬁed via rulesets, but fall short\non “business logic” vulnerabilities that are deﬁned by their\ncontext like improper authorization. We encountered no\ncases in our testing where using a Codex model led to better\nor more efﬁcient results than SAST tools. We expect that\nsufﬁciently capable models will excel at discovering these\ntypes of high-dimension vulnerabilities, so this is an area\nfor further research as model capabilities improve.\nWe investigated whether Codex models would suggest vul-\nnerable, malicious, or typosquatted software dependencies\nas part of a supply chain attack. For example, speciﬁc ver-\nsions of Python packages may contain vulnerabilities that\nwould render a downstream application vulnerable as well.\nHowever, Codex is generally unable to suggest speciﬁc ver-\nsions of packages, as package versions are speciﬁed outside\nof the prompt context that Codex is aware of.20Also wor-\nrying is the possibility of Codex suggesting malicious or\ntyposquatted packages (Ohm et al., 2020). Through test-\ning, we found that the likelihood of Codex suggesting a\nvulnerable or malicious package is low in aggregate. How-\never, when prompted with an initial misspelled stem of a\ntyposquatted package that was previously removed from\nPyPi, Codex would complete the suggestion. Similarly,\nCodex will suggest a typosquatted package if asked to use\nthe package speciﬁcally. In summary, Codex does not miti-\ngate human error with misspelled package names. If Codex\nhas a tendency to complete misspelled package names, then\nthis could constitute an attack vector for typosquatting.\nWe explored whether Codex models would be suitable for\ngenerating phishing pretext. We found that models trained\non source code offered no advantages over conventional\nlanguage models because the domains are fundamentally\ndifferent.21\nBecause of the training process of pre-training and ﬁne-\ntuning on public data, there is a natural trust boundary\n19For more on characterizing Codex’s capability limitations, see\nthe Limitations section.\n20While Python package imports may be observable in the\nprompt context, package version information is relegated to a\nseparate manifest ﬁle and/or the installed package ﬁles themselves.\n21See Section 6.1.3 of Brown et al. (2020) for an analysis of\nconventional language models\nEvaluating Large Language Models Trained on Code\npresent in the training data, wherein an attacker could insert\nadversarial inputs that cause models to suggest vulnerable,\nmalicious, or misaligned code. The pre-training and ﬁne-\ntuning processes should generally be thought of as untrusted.\nThis risk may increase as model capabilities and the interest\nof potential attackers increase.\nFinally, the Codex model itself may suggest insecure or\notherwise bad code. Examples include suggesting a com-\npromised package as a dependency, invoking functions inse-\ncurely, or suggesting secrets found in the training data.22If\nCodex models become widespread software infrastructure,\nthis could constitute a new type of supply chain risk. We\ndiscuss this more in the next section.\nBeyond computer security, we also considered the possibil-\nity that code generation systems might provide actors with\nthe ability to synthesize portions of highly complex safety-\ncritical systems with offensive capabilities. We concluded\nthat there is a low likelihood of Codex synthesizing stand-\nalone safety-critical systems due to a lack of system-level\ngeneration capabilities, as discussed in Appendix D. Codex\nmodels could also potentially accelerate some instances of\nmachine learning development, which in turn could have\ndownstream misuse implications. While again Codex does\nnot appear capable of synthesizing highly complex systems,\nwe have found it to be somewhat effective at generating boil-\nerplate machine learning code that has a similar structure to\ncode it has seen in its training set.\nAs with GPT-3, we discussed possible misuse scenarios\nwith professional threat analysts and monitored forums for\nevidence of actors using language models to generate code\nto augment cybercrime operations. We observed enthusiasm\nfor training models on code and projects focused on au-\ntomating coding tasks, but no references to using language\nmodels for malware development. We noted that enthusiasm\nand projects were centered around freely-available language\nmodels. This highlights a need for robust monitoring and\ncontinued research to maintain situational awareness about\nhow models like Codex are being used and misused.\nG.3. Insecure code generation\nSimilar to the alignment problems in Appendix E, a security-\nrelevant subclass of behaviors is the generation of insecure\ncode. A priori, we might expect that Codex will sometimes\nproduce insecure code because the pre-training and ﬁne-\ntuning paradigm involves training on large quantities of\nuntrusted data, which is known to contain insecure code.\nA simple mental model is that Codex can pick up “bad\nhabits” from its training data. But what does this look like\n22Previous work (Carlini et al., 2021) has found that it is possible\nto extract training data from large language models.in practice?23\nTo study this phenomenon, we asked Codex to suggest code\nthat would call cryptographic libraries to generate crypto-\ngraphic contexts, and then evaluated whether any of these\noutputs were clearly insecure.24When tested on a standard\nseries of prompts asking the models to call functions to\nproduce RSA keys or AES contexts,25we ﬁnd that Codex\nmodels of varying sizes frequently use clearly insecure con-\nﬁgurations (See Figure 15).\nInterestingly, we do not see a robust model size trend (over 1\norder of magnitude of parameters) in this data. This suggests\nthat insecure code production, at least in this case, is an\nalignment issue (see Appendix E): it is unclear if the models\nare improving with scale. A larger study using the most\ncommon insecure code vulnerabilities may shed more light\non this issue.\nH. Supplemental economic analysis\nThe economic and labor market implications of code gener-\nation are only beginning to emerge, and more analysis will\nbe required to fully understand them. In this appendix, we\noutline some possible types of impacts that occur, but we\nemphasize that this analysis is highly preliminary: many\nuncertainties remain about the technological trajectory and\neconomic adoption of code generation. We include this anal-\nysis primarily to motivate further related work rather than\nto suggest any strong conclusions, and we will highlight\nseveral promising directions for further exploration.\nCode generation could help create economic value by allow-\ning engineers and programmers to write better code, write\n23Previous work (Schuster et al., 2020) has found that it is\npossible to poison training data for code autocompleters and trigger\nthem at runtime to make insecure suggestions such as improper\ncryptographic function usage.\n24This corresponds to the OWASP Top 10 2017 Category A6\n- Security Misconﬁguration (owa, 2017), or MITRE’s CWE-327\n(cwe, 2006). For example, MITRE recommends (cwe, 2009) that\nRSA keys must be 2048 bits or larger. We test Codex’s ability to\nproduce keys with this property in this experiment.\n25We used 5 prompts across different libraries for RSA and\nAES based on Sonar Source’s Python vulnerability database, and\ngenerated ˜30k samples total. We then removed some generated\nsamples based on expected runtime errors, as different model sizes\ntend to vary in whether they produce code that runs.\nRSA keys were considered improperly conﬁgured if they were\nshorter than 2048 bits.\nAES contexts were considered improperly conﬁgured if they\nused the ECB cipher mode (see Menezes et al. (2018), p. 228).\nThere is more complexity behind choosing an appropriate cipher\nthan not using ECB, however this test was chosen because ECB is\nrarely desired.\nWe chose these two tests to evaluate as targets because there is\nconsensus among cryptography experts that these conﬁgurations\ngenerally should not be used, and these were reasonable to evaluate\nprogrammatically.\nEvaluating Large Language Models Trained on Code\nFigure 15. Clearly insecure encryption keys produced by\nCodex. When asked to create encryption keys, Codex models\nselect clearly insecure conﬁguration parameters in a signiﬁcant\nfraction of cases. We evaluated outputs as clearly insecure if: (a)\nRSA keys were shorter than 2048 bits, (b) AES contexts used the\nECB cipher mode. Because security standards change over time as\ncapabilities improve, this is likely an underestimate of the true rate\nof improperly conﬁgured outputs. Similarly, the produced sam-\nples that were not classiﬁed as clearly insecure are not necessarily\nsecure, as our tests measure insecurity.\ngood code faster, and help with tasks like docstrings, docu-\nmentation, tests, code reviews, etc. In turn, these impacts\nmay change the work of engineers and programmers (people\nwho directly write or read code for a living) as well as work\nmore broadly by lowering the barrier to building software\nand enabling entirely new kinds of software to be built.\nCodex is one of several existing tools to assist in code gen-\neration, which have varying economic implications. We\nfocus here on ways in which Codex might have a larger im-\npact than previous code generation tools given its stronger\nperformance with the Python language.\nH.1. Impacts on programmers and engineers\nAt a coarse-grained level, by potentially increasing program-\nmer and engineer productivity, Codex may somewhat reduce\nthe overall cost of producing software. This effect may be\nlimited by the fact that the production of software requires\nmore tasks than writing code (O*NET, 2021)–other impor-\ntant tasks include conferring with colleagues, writing design\nspecs, and upgrading existing software stacks. Indeed, the\nBureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) classiﬁes computer pro-\ngrammers and software developers separately, where devel-\nopers are more highly paid than programmers, have more\ntasks indirectly related to writing and interacting with code,\nand, in the US, are projected to see greater demand over the\nnext 10 years (Li et al., 2020).\nAdditionally, one of the challenges of code generation stemfrom relying on the assumption that intent is captured suf-\nﬁciently enough in comments and documentation to not\ncompromise accuracy. This in turn implies some inherent\noverhead: framing comments and prompts precisely enough\nto extract the best behavior from the model and reviewing\nthe code generated by the model. Thus, even if the model\nwere perfectly accurate, we would not expect it to reduce\nthe labor costs associated with writing code to zero. Fur-\nthermore, as with many tools that substitute investments in\ncapital for investments in labor (or increase the productiv-\nity of labor) (Frey, 2019; Acemoglu & Restrepo, 2020a;b),\nmore sophisticated future code generation tools could poten-\ntially contribute to the displacement of some programmer or\nengineer roles, and could change the nature of, and power\ndynamics involved in, programming work. However, they\nmight instead simply make the work of some engineers\nmore efﬁcient, or, if used to produce larger amounts of\nsloppier code, they could create the illusion of increased\nefﬁciency while ofﬂoading the time spent writing code to\nmore detailed code reviews and QA testing.\nAt the same time, Codex may create new markets for work\nthat complement changed workﬂows. After the release of\nGPT-3, a few companies began to include working with\nGPT-3 and writing prompts in job listings. And research\nshows that so-called prompt engineering can enable stronger\nresults from AI systems (Zhao et al., 2021). Similarly, it\nis possible that models like Codex will lead to the emer-\ngence of new kinds of work for engineers who are skilled at\nworking with such tools.\nBecause of Codex’s performance on “coding challenge” like\nquestions (as referenced in the APPS results), we expect\nstrong performance on interview-style questions. This may\nencourage employers to reconsider the screening process\nfor coding-related positions.\nH.2. Differential impacts among engineers\nCertain kinds of code and roles may be more likely to be\naffected by the diffusion of code generation models than\nothers. It is thus valuable to explore whether systematic\npatterns might be expected in who might win and lose from\nthis class of technologies across demographic categories.\nGiven Codex’s performance on Python, we expect its im-\npacts to be felt more strongly in roles where Python is the\ndominant programming language (future models might have\ndifferent strength proﬁles).26However, even if this were\n26There is unfortunately only limited research on the demo-\ngraphic distribution of Python users. Understanding this better\ncould shed light on how the beneﬁts and risks associated with\nCodex might be distributed across society. A 2020 survey of Stack-\nOverﬂow users (Stack Overﬂow, 2020) suggests that women are\ncomparatively more represented in data science and analysis roles\nthan in DevOps specialist, system administrator, and site reliability\nEvaluating Large Language Models Trained on Code\ntrue, whether the effect is positive or negative may vary\nwith how engineers and programmers learn to incorporate\nthese tools into their workﬂows. One might think that those\nwho work with programming languages that Codex excels\nat would have the most to lose in the event that tools built\non top of these models substitute for human labor. How-\never, such workers may alternatively have more to gain if\nthose tools enhance their productivity and bargaining power.\nRelatedly, more companies might switch their codebases\nto programming languages where they know Codex could\naugment work.\nIt is also important to note that use of Python is actively\ngrowing, in part because it is a dominant language used\nin educational contexts and because of its high readability\nfactor. By increasing the amount that can be achieved with\nPython, Codex might make the engineering ﬁeld more ac-\ncessible to a wider variety of people, including those coming\nfrom a more diverse range of demographic backgrounds.\nH.3. Impacts on non-engineers\nCode generation tools could also widen the base of people\nwho are able to move into programming or shift the distribu-\ntion of skills that new programmers need to learn (Xu et al.,\n2021). One mechanism through which this may happen is\nthat Codex may make it easier to work with new codebases\nor new languages.\nCode generation models may also make it simpler to build\ntools that automate repetitive tasks in non-engineering roles.\nH.4. Effects of differential package import rates\nWithin a code ﬁle, one often imports packages or programs\nwritten by third parties. Rather than constantly reinventing\nthe wheel, software developers rely on functions, libraries\nand APIs for most code we might consider “boilerplate.” For\nany given task, though, there are multiple options: PyTorch\nor TensorFlow for machine learning, Matplotlib or Seaborn\nfor data visualization, etc.\nCodex imports substitutable packages at different rates\nbased on patterns in its training data, which can have various\nengineer roles while a 2020 survey of Python developers (Python\nSoftware Foundation and JetBrains, 2020) suggests that those data\nscience and analysis roles are some of the most common Python\nuse cases. Given this, we might anticipate that women would\nbe disproportionately affected–positively or negatively–by Codex.\nHowever, we emphasize that those surveys may not be representa-\ntive for various reasons (e.g. selective participation of community\nmembers in the survey; non-representativeness of the community\nas a sample of the overall developer and Python communities,\nrespectively). We mention these results merely to illustrate the po-\ntential for code generation’s economic effects to be felt unequally\nacross society and to motivate more rigorous research in related\nareas.possible implications. Differential import rates by Codex\nmight lead to subtle errors in cases where a certain import\nis ill-advised, increase robustness in cases where the al-\nternative package imported by an individual would have\nbeen worse, and/or increase the dominance of an already-\ninﬂuential set of individuals and organizations in the soft-\nware supply chain. Despite many packages being free, there\nare clear rewards for developers and ﬁrms that have high-use\npackages, and free packages can be wrappers for paid prod-\nucts. Thus, the patterns of importing in Codex and other\ncode generation models could have substantial economic\nimplications for those who build and maintain packages, as\nwell as safety or security implications.27\nMany commonly used packages are fairly entrenched and\nthere can be high switching costs. Using the same package\nas everyone else means one’s code will be more compatible\n(if one uses a package everyone knows they will inherently\nunderstand one’s use of it), more trustworthy (if one uses\na package everyone already has installed they will not be\nafraid to install new things to run one’s code), and just\ngenerally work better with other code (if one uses a package\neveryone uses, others will be a lot more able to run one’s\ncode out of the box or plug it into their package). A given\npackage might be dominant because it is the best available\nstandard in terms of speed, security, or accessibility. Most\nof these packages are not paid, so the associated costs are\nmostly in learning to use new packages and the different\ntrade-offs and syntax.\nThe scale of these effects for Codex may be relatively low\nif users mostly import packages they know how to use or\nhave done outside research on, so they can double-check\nanything the model does. Moreover, because packages are\ngenerally imported at the top of a ﬁle without any comments,\nthe model has very little to go on in these cases, so users\nwould most likely have to start typing out the name of the\npackage they want to import rather than trusting the model\nto know they are starting a machine learning project and\nwant to import either PyTorch or TensorFlow.\nDependence on code generation models’ import suggestions\nmay grow over time as users adapt to working with such\nsystems. As users learn how to “prompt engineer” with\nCodex, they may use the model as a decision-making tool\nor search engine. Where a user may have done an Internet\nsearch before for “which machine learning package to use”\nor “pros and cons of PyTorch vs. Tensorﬂow” they might\nnow just type “# import machine learning package” and\n27As one example, we looked at completions of the prompt:\n# import machine learning package\nimport\nand found that over 100 completions of 100 tokens, 6 contained\nsuggestions for TensorFlow and 3 for PyTorch, two libraries that\nare rough substitutes.\nEvaluating Large Language Models Trained on Code\ntrust Codex to do the rest. Users might be more inclined\nto accept the Codex answer under the assumption that the\npackage it suggests is the one with which Codex will be\nmore helpful. As a result, certain players might become\nmore entrenched in the package market and Codex might\nnot be aware of new packages developed after the training\ndata was originally gathered. Further, for already existing\npackages, the model may make suggestions for deprecated\nmethods. This could increase open-source developers’ in-\ncentive to maintain backward compatibility, which could\npose challenges given that open-source projects are often\nunder-resourced (Eghbal, 2020; Trinkenreich et al., 2021).\nMore work is needed to compare the prevalence of different\npackages in Codex outputs with the input data to understand\nhow or if these biases are concentrated by training, as well\nas to understand the direct and indirect impacts of these\nbiases.\nH.5. Future directions\nPrecise and accurate prediction of any impacts without user\nor market signal is difﬁcult, but the potential implications\non the long-run labor market and the possibility of disparate\noutcomes across groups warrant further exploration of these\nissues. It may be possible to assess the relative likelihood\nof different scenarios by building a deeper understanding of\nCodex’s capabilities across several code-related tasks or by\nstudying the effects of precise deployment scenarios. We\nplan to support research measuring Codex’s particular im-\npact as well as research on code generation and automation\nmore generally.\nWe recommend future work focused on Codex models and\nother similar systems, with an eye towards positively inﬂu-\nencing both the deployment of such technologies and any\nother necessary steps by key actors such as governments.\nSome areas which we are particularly interested in seeing\nresearch include:\n•Measuring the economic value of generating faster\nand/or better code. This can include tracking the down-\nstream impacts of tools created with Codex, including\nthose which may not have been possible to build previ-\nously (at all, or by speciﬁc individuals or teams).\n•Measuring changes in code documentation practices\nand testing as a result of Codex. Codex may make it\neasier to keep code well-documented, but it may also\npropagate subtle errors in documentation that lead to\nbugs downstream. Similarly, Codex can help people\nwrite tests for code, which can dramatically improve\nsoftware quality and the surface area for costly down-\nstream bugs, but if engineers become overly reliant,\nthey may not properly specify code. (Planning, 2002;\nJones & Bonsignour, 2011).•Measuring the impact on worker productivity, quality\nof life, and wages of improved code generation tech-\nnologies. Most past studies of the impacts of code gen-\neration models consider performance on a closed set of\ntasks in a simulated environment (Xu et al., 2021). As\nthe deployment of Codex and other near-term technolo-\ngies proceeds, we may be able to conduct more robust\nexperiments examining the impact of various strengths\nof models on real-world job performance, across teams\nand across ﬁrms.\n•Measuring the ability of Codex and other code gener-\nation models to reduce barriers to entry for the ﬁeld.\nSuch work could explore various ways in which the\neducational and career progression of programmers\nand engineers could be inﬂuenced by the availability\nof powerful code generation technologies.\nMore broadly, we believe the ﬁndings in this paper and\nfuture research on code generation might encourage re-\nsearchers and policymakers to update their views regarding\nthe potential for AI to have substitutive effects on workers\nin various high-skill domains in the future. As capabilities\nimprove, the effects of this class of technologies could be\nsubstantial and more study is needed both on the effects and\non appropriate responses."

The diversity in hardware and parallel programming models\nmake developing, optimizing, and maintaining parallel software\neven more burdensome for developers. One way to alleviate some\nof these burdens is with automated development and analysis\ntools. Such tools can perform complex and/or remedial tasks\nfor developers that increase their productivity and decrease the\nchance for error. Until recently, such tools for code development\nand performance analysis have been limited in the complexity\nof tasks they can perform, especially for parallel programs.\nHowever, with recent advancements in language modeling, and\nthe availability of large amounts of open-source code related data,\nthese tools have started to utilize predictive language models\nto automate more complex tasks. In this paper, we show how\nlarge language models (LLMs) can be applied to tasks speciﬁc\nto high performance and scientiﬁc codes. We introduce a new\ndataset of HPC and scientiﬁc codes and use it to ﬁne-tune several\npre-trained models. We compare several pre-trained LLMs on\nHPC-related tasks and introduce a new model, HPC-Coder , ﬁne-\ntuned on parallel codes. In our experiments, we show that this\nmodel can auto-complete HPC functions where generic models\ncannot, decorate for loops with OpenMP pragmas, and model\nperformance changes in scientiﬁc application repositories as well\nas programming competition solutions.\nIndex Terms —large language models, parallel code generation,\nperformance modeling\nI. I NTRODUCTION\nIn recent years, large language models (LLMs) have become\nthe state of the art for many language modeling related\ntasks [1]. Their ability to model token probabilities within\na sequential context make them desirable for language tasks\nsuch as text generation and sequence classiﬁcation. In addition\nto being used for natural language, such models have recently\nbeen applied to many programming language related tasks [2]–\n[4]. The predictive capabilities of these models translate well\nto coding tasks, and the wealth of open-source code available\nonline provides signiﬁcant data for training large models.\nLLMs trained on source code data have been utilized to\nautomate numerous software development tasks such as code\ncompletion, malware detection, code refactoring, etc [3]–[12].\nAdditionally, they have been able to automate tasks previously\nconsidered impossible to automate such as code summariza-\ntion and generation using natural language. Training LLMs\nfor these tasks requires signiﬁcant amounts of source codedata that is fortunately available online from open-source\ncode repositories on GitHub, gitlab etc. However, this data\nrequirement for training LLMs is prohibitive for tasks where\nsuch data may not exist. One such task is that of modeling\nperformance (execution time) based on source code. Another\ndifﬁcult task is modeling parallel and HPC code where there\nis less data available and it is often more complex code.\nPerformance data for arbitrary code is difﬁcult to obtain at\nscale with large numbers of samples. First and foremost, it\nis non-trivial to automate the collection of performance data\nfor arbitrary source code. The code needs to be built and\nrun in order to measure performance, and this process can\nvary signiﬁcantly across repositories. This can be particularly\ndifﬁcult for production scientiﬁc codes due to code complexity,\ndependence on external libraries, and the fact that it often\nneeds to be run in parallel with many resources. Second,\nperformance depends on numerous variables besides just the\ncode such as input problem, architecture, and current machine\nload/congestion. These either need to be ﬁxed in the dataset\nor accounted for within the modeling pipeline. Finally, source\ncode needs to be considered holistically when modeling per-\nformance, since minor changes in one place may drastically\nimpact performance elsewhere. For example, changing the data\nlayout within a data structure will impact the performance of\ndata access where that structure is used. This means that the\nentirety of the source code needs to be included in the dataset\nand performance needs to be collected at a ﬁner granularity.\nWhen a lack of data becomes a hurdle in machine learning\ntasks, it is typically solved through data augmentation and/or\ntransfer learning. Data augmentation involves extending and/or\nduplicating data in a manner that still preserves meaning\nand representational capacity. Transfer learning is done by\nﬁrst training a model on a related or simpler task and then\ntransferring that knowledge to a new problem requiring fewer\nsamples to learn. For our task we employ transfer learning\nby using LLMs that have learned to model source code and\nthen transferring that knowledge to then learn how to model\nperformance of source code using fewer samples. In particular,\nwe explore modeling parallel and HPC codes.\nIn this paper, we utilize LLMs to model high performance\nand scientiﬁc codes, and then apply that to the problem\nof performance modeling. In order to accomplish this, we\nintroduce a new dataset of HPC and scientiﬁc codes from\npopular open-source repositories. We ﬁrst demonstrate how\nour trained model, HPC-Coder , outperforms other LLMs on\nHPC speciﬁc tasks such as code generation and OpenMP\npragma labeling. A set of code generation tests speciﬁc to\nHPC are introduced and the model can pass these at up to\n53% higher rate than the other models. Additionally, it is able\nto label for loops with OpenMP pragmas with 97% accuracy.\nFinally, we demonstrate how the model can predict relative\nperformance of source code changes with up to 92% accuracy.\nIn summary, this paper makes the following contributions:\n\u000fA large curated dataset containing HPC and scientiﬁc\ncode from numerous open-source repositories.\n\u000fWe present an LLM, HPC-Coder , ﬁne-tuned to model\nHPC and scientiﬁc code. We show that it trains to better\nlanguage modeling scores over HPC related code than\nother state-of-the-art models.\n\u000fWe introduce a set of HPC code generation tasks and\ndemonstrate that our model completes these tasks at\na signiﬁcantly better rate than other models on HPC-\nspeciﬁc code.\n\u000fWe demonstrate how our model can be used to predict\nOpenMP pragmas with high accuracy.\n\u000fWe utilize our model to predict relative performance\nof source code changes for two distinct datasets from\nscientiﬁc application repositories and coding competition\nsolutions.\nII. B ACKGROUND\nThis section provides background on transformer-based\nlanguage models and how they can be applied to source code.\nA. Large Language Models\nWhen applying machine learning to textual data we need\na model that takes text as input and, through the process of\ntraining on previous data, learns how to predict some property\nof that text. In recent years such models have been mostly\ndominated by large transformer-based models. Transformers\nwere ﬁrst introduced by Vaswani et al. [13]. They are designed\nto work with sequential data much like recurrent and long\nshort-term memory neural networks. However, they differ in\ntheir use of a self-attention mechanism to attribute importance\nweights to inputs into the model. Due to this mechanism\ntransformers also process entire sequences at once unlike\nrecurrent neural networks.\nThese self-attention units make up the basis of transformer\nnetworks. Weights are divided into query, key, and value\nweights (namely WQ,WK,WV). These are multiplied by\neach input token iand stacked to form the matrices Q,K,\nandV, respectively. Given these matrices and the dimensions\nof the key vector dkthe attention can be computed as below.\nAttention (Q;K;V ) =softmax\u0012QKT\npdk\u0013\nV\nThese weight matrices form a single attention head. Typ-\nically transformers employ several attention heads to forma multi-attention head layer. Having multiple attention heads\nallows each of them to learn, or attend to , different abstractions\nin the input, such as parts-of-speech for natural language input.\nGenerally these networks are trained to model the condi-\ntional probability of observing a language token or a sequence\nof tokens. For instance, given a string of observed tokens\nt1t2:::ti1we may want the most likely next token ti.\nti= arg max\ntP(ti=tjt1t2:::ti1)\nSimilarly we may want to know the probability of a se-\nquence of tokens occurring given the entire observed dataset\nP(t1;t2;:::;t N)(i.e. how likely is a given english sentence to\nbe real given my previous knowledge of the language). Using\nthis probability we can deﬁne a metric called perplexity .\nPerplexity (T) =\u00121\nP(t1;t2;:::;t N)\u00131\nN\nWith this metric a model that scores a lower perplexity on\nits test setTis better as it assigns a higher probability to the\ntest data. The ratio is normalized to be invariant to the size of\nthe test set. Rewriting the formula for perplexity we can see\nthat it is equivalent to the exponential of the cross-entropy.\nPerplexity (T) = (P(t1;t2;:::;t N))1\nN\n= (exp logP(t1;t2;:::;t N))1\nN\n= exp\u0012\n1\nNlogP(t1;t2;:::;t N)\u0013\nThis allows us to train the language model with cross-\nentropy loss. Minimizing the loss will, in turn, minimize the\nperplexity. The perplexity is recovered by simply taking the\nexponential of the loss. It is important to note that perplexity\nmeasures model conﬁdence and not accuracy. However, it has\nbeen demonstrated empirically that lower perplexity generally\nleads to better performance on downstream tasks.\nB. Text Generation\nA trained model can then be used to generate new text. Since\nthe LLM models token probability it may seem simple to select\nthe most probable next token, however, this can lead to poor\ntext generation. Often a model’s attention puts more focus on\non the most recent tokens causing this selection method to get\nstuck in loops or suddenly forget context. Most recent works\ncombat this issue by sampling from the model’s distribution,\nbut there are several important caveats when doing this. For\ninstance, we want to avoid sampling from the tail as this could\ndrastically throw off further tokens sampled. Here we discuss\nseveral of the sampling methods used later in this paper such\nas temperature, top- k, and nucleus sampling.\nTemperature: When sampling temperature controls how con-\nﬁdent the model is in the sampled token. Lower temperature\nleads the model to assign more conﬁdence in the most likely\ntokens in the distribution. On the other end, the model will\nmore uniformly assign conﬁdence across the distribution when\nthe temperature is higher. This term comes from statistical\nthermodynamics where lower energy states are more frequent\nwith a higher temperature.\nTemperature is incorporated by dividing the logits by the\ntemperature, temp , before computing the softmax output. The\nlogits are the raw, un-normalized outputs of the model and the\nsoftmax is used to turn this vector into probabilities.\nsoftmax\u0012logits\ntemp\u0013\nThus, as temp!0the output becomes the argmax and as\ntemp!1 it leads to a uniform sampling.\nTop-kSampling: In top-ksampling the most likely ktokens\nare sampled from the model. This aims to exclude the distribu-\ntion’s tail and prevent the model from rapidly getting off-topic.\nHowever, this can also reduce the quality of predictions if the\nbody of the distribution is wider than k. A common choice\nforkis 50.\nNucleus Sampling: Nucleus, or top- p, sampling aims to solve\nthe shortcomings of top- ksampling by choosing a more\nmeaningful cut-off point. In this method the CDF of the\ndistribution is computed and sampling is cut-off when the CDF\nexceedsp. A common choice for pis0:9.\nC. Using LLMs for Code Generation\nLLMs can be trained on a variety of downstream tasks and\nobjectives. When applied to source code data they are typically\ntrained as left-to-right, masked, or encoder-decoder models.\nLeft-to-Right: Left-to-right or causal language models are\ntrained to predict the most probable next token in a sequence.\nThe model receives and generates text in a left-to-right fashion,\nwhich is where it gets its name. This limits the amount of\ncontext the model can see as it cannot use later tokens in its\nprediction even if they are present in the data. Left-to-right\nmodels are useful for text generation related tasks.\nMasked: Unlike left-to-right models, masked models can\npredict the most probable token for any position in the text.\nAfter removing random tokens in the samples and replacing\nthem with mask tokens, the model is trained to predict the\nmost probable tokens to replace the masks with. In this\nconﬁguration masked models can make use of more context\nin their predictions.\nEncoder-Decoder: Another common approach is to train a\nleft-to-right model to decode a sequence after it has been\npassed through an encoder. This type of model can be com-\nbined with several different objectives and is often used with\nsequence-to-sequence prediction.\nTo apply left-to-right models, which are focused on in this\npaper, to source code you simply need to provide the model\nwith prior context as a sequence of tokens and then let it\ngenerate new tokens until some stopping threshold. The prior\ncontext is typically a natural language comment followed by\na function declaration. Tokens are then generated until the\nfunction is complete (a closing gbracket in the case of C/C++).Additionally, when applying language models to code it is\ntypical to customize the training process slightly to take ad-\nvantage of the syntactic differences between natural language\nand code. For instance, the tokenizer, which is responsible for\nmapping text to a sequence of integers, is often set to group\nwhitespace into single tokens. This is not necessary in natural\nlanguage inputs as multiple consecutive spaces are uncommon.\nHowever, in code this can meaningfully reduce the sequence\nsize and a formatter can be applied after code generation to\nregain formatting.\nIII. O VERVIEW OF THE PROPOSED METHODOLOGY\nFigure 1 provides an overview of the data gathering, train-\ning, and downstream application in this paper. In order to train\na large HPC-speciﬁc language model we need a large dataset\nof HPC code. To obtain this, we gather a dataset of HPC\nsource code and use it to ﬁne-tune a pre-trained language\nmodel. This data gathering is described in Section IV and\npresents what HPC sources are used and how they are pre-\nprocessed. Following this, the model ﬁne-tuning and selection\nare detailed in Section V where we explain the training setup\nand methodology.\nFig. 1. Overview of the steps described in this paper to train an HPC speciﬁc\nmodel and run it on several downstream tasks. After collecting a large dataset\nof HPC code we ﬁne-tune several pre-trained language models and select the\nbest one. The selected model is then used to generate code, label OpenMP\npragmas, and predict relative performance as part of several downstream tasks.\nWe need several realistic tests to study the performance of\nthe language model on relevant metrics. We present three main\ndownstream tasks for evaluation in Section VI. The ﬁrst two,\ncode generation and OpenMP pragma labeling, test the model\non its ability to generate correct and meaningful code. The last\ntest, relative performance prediction, shows how this trained\nmodel can be used for useful tasks that require language\ncomprehension. Results from each of these tests are presented\nand discussed in Section VII.\nIV. D ATA GATHERING AND PRE-PROCESSING\nIn order to train a large language model to understand and\ngenerate HPC code, we need to show it lots of examples. We\nmust ﬁrst build a dataset to accomplish this. In this section,\nwe detail our collected dataset and how it is processed. We\npresent two additional code datasets paired with performance\ndata for further ﬁne-tuning model performance.\nA. HPC Source Code Data\nWe ﬁrst collect a sufﬁciently large dataset of source code to\ntrain the model on HPC and scientiﬁc code. The HPC source\ndataset is collected from GitHub repositories. The source ﬁles\nare pulled from repositories with C/C++ marked as the primary\nlanguage and with \u00153stars. The repositories are additionally\nﬁltered by HPC related GitHub topics. Once cloned, we collect\nall the C/C++ source ﬁles based on their ﬁle extension.\nThis dataset is collected and structured in the same manner\nas the C/C++ source dataset from Xu et al. [14]. Their dataset\nis scraped from GitHub in a similar manner with the exception\nof only including repositories with \u00155stars. Figure 2 shows\nthe distribution of lines of code (LOC) by ﬁle types in the\nHPC source dataset. There are roughly the same number of\nLOC in both C and C++ ﬁles. The distribution of actual ﬁle\ncounts follows the same trend.\nFig. 2. Distribution of no. of lines of code in each ﬁle type. .cxx, .hh,.H, and\n.hxx ﬁles are included in the dataset, but omitted here due to small counts.\nB. Data Pre-processing\nAllamanis [15] shows how duplicate source data, which\nis prevalent across GitHub repositories, can adversely bias\nLLMs during training. To prevent this we ﬁlter our datasets by\nremoving duplicate ﬁles based on the hash of their contents.\nWe use sha256 to hash the contents of the ﬁle.\nIn addition to deduplicating we also ﬁlter out small and\nlarge ﬁles. Source ﬁles larger than 1 MB are designated as\nlarge ﬁles and removed. These are generally entire libraries\nin a single source ﬁle or contain raw data within the code.\nAdditionally, ﬁles containing less than 15 tokens, as deﬁned\nby the language vocab, are not included. The reduced dataset\nsizes after deduplication and ﬁltering are listed in Table I.\nApproximately 18% of the ﬁles are removed during this\nprocessing. Table I shows the properties of the dataset after\neach step of deduplication and ﬁltering.\nTABLE I\nPROPERTIES OF THE HPC SOURCE CODE DATASET .\nFilter # Files # LOC Size (GB)\nNone 239,469 61,585,704 2.02\nDeduplicate 198,958 53,043,265 1.74\nDeduplicate + remove\nsmall/large ﬁles196,140 50,017,351 1.62After ﬁltering source ﬁles, we tokenize the dataset to obtain\ninteger values for the text that can be used as input into\nthe model. We use the pre-trained tokenizers for each of our\nselected models (see Section V). These are all GPT-2 [16]\nbased Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) tokenizers.\nC. Performance Datasets\nIn addition to the large HPC source code dataset, we create\ntwo datasets of code paired with performance data. These\ndatasets contain code pairs with performance data for both\ncodes in the pair, and can be used to train an LLM to model\nperformance characteristics between them.\nWe create two datasets – one with pairs of code that are\nfunctionally different and one where they are the same. The\nﬁrst dataset is created by using version control history to\ncapture performance regressions. We run each commit for the\nKripke [17] and Laghos [18] applications. These are small\nHPC apps meant to mimic the computational behavior of larger\nscientiﬁc applications. We automate building and running each\ncommit to the best of our ability and collect performance\nresults for 830 commits in total.\nThe second dataset is a set of programming competition\nsolutions from the code contests dataset [19]. These are\naggregated from several online programming competitions:\nAizu, AtCoder, CodeChef, CodeForces, and HackerEarth. This\ndataset allows us to create pairs of code that solve the\nsame problem (the contest problem), but may be different\nin implementation. We run every correct solution for each\nproblem in the dataset, with the corresponding problem’s test\ncases as inputs, and record the run time. Using all the C++\nsolutions in the dataset we create \u00181.7 million samples of\ncode. Using the run times, we group the solutions into pairs\nand label them as slower andfaster pairs.\nV. F INE-TUNING METHODOLOGY\nIn this section, we describe the models used and how they\nwere selected. We also discuss the methods used to ﬁne-tune\nthem on our collected dataset.\nA. Models Selected For Fine-tuning\nRecent years have seen the introduction of a signiﬁcant\nnumber of large language models. These models can range\nin size from 100 million to more than 100 billion parameters.\nSuch large models have been shown to work well for language\nmodeling, but pose signiﬁcant hurdles to train and use in\npractice. They can take months to train on large GPU clusters\nand typically cannot feasibly run inference on consumer-grade\nhardware. Thus, choosing the right model requires selecting\none that can sufﬁciently model the language data, but also be\nreasonably deployed for downstream tasks.\nKeeping the above mentioned requirements in mind, we\nselect several models for ﬁne-tuning and/or testing. These\nare listed in Table II. All of these are based on GPT-2 [16]\nand/or GPT-3 [23] architectures with slight variations in size,\nconﬁguration, and pre-training data. GPT-2, the smallest in our\nexperiments, is pre-trained on the WebText [20] dataset, which\n\nTABLE II\nDESCRIPTION OF THE MODELS USED FOR FINE -TUNING .\nModel # Params. # LayersHidden\nSizeWindow\nSizePre-Training\nSet\nGPT-2 [16] 1.5B 48 1600 1024 WebText [20]\nGPT-Neo [21] 2.7B 32 2560 256 Pile [22]\nPolyCoder [14] 2.7B 32 2560 2048 Source Code\nis a collection of language data scraped from the internet.\nWe use the 1.5 billion parameter GPT-2 model variant in this\npaper. PolyCoder [14] is pre-trained on a collection of solely\nsource code data from GitHub that contains a mixture of 12\npopular programming languages [14]. Between these two is\nGPT-Neo [21] that is pre-trained on the Pile dataset [22]. This\ndataset contains a collection of approximately 800GB of text\ndata from the internet, academic articles, source code, etc.\nNotably this dataset has a mixture of natural language and\ncode. It has been demonstrated that pre-training over both\nnatural language and code can improve the performance of\nthe model.\nWe exclude models such as GPT-4 [24], the state-of-the-art\nmodel that powers GitHub CoPilot, from our experiments due\nto the model and its dataset being closed source. It is currently\nonly accessible for inference via a non-free API. GPT-4’s\ndataset being closed source is signiﬁcant as we cannot remove\ndata it has trained on from the dataset we use to evaluate its\nperformance, so its results would be overly optimistic. This\nprevents a realistic evaluation and comparison.\nB. Fine-tuning Setup and Hyperparameters\nWe rely on the functionality provided in the Hugging-\nFace [25] Python library for ﬁne-tuning the models. This\nlibrary automates many of the tasks related to loading and\npre-processing datasets, and running language models on\nthe datasets. In particular, we use the Trainer interface\nwith DeepSpeed [26] as the backend to optimize ﬁne-tuning.\nDeepSpeed is a framework that provides distributed training\nfunctionality and several memory optimizations to enable large\nmodels to ﬁt in GPU memory.\nStarting with the pre-trained models, we ﬁne-tune them on a\nsingle node with an AMD EPYC 7763 CPU, 512 GB memory,\nand four 40 GB NVIDIA A100 GPUs. With DeepSpeed’s\nZeRO memory optimizations [27], all of the models ﬁt entirely\nwithin a single A100 GPU and are, thus, ﬁne-tuned using\npure data parallelism. We refer the reader to [28], [29] for\na comprehensive overview of training deep neural networks\nin parallel.\nWe use the AdamW [30] optimizer for all the models to up-\ndate model weights and minimize the loss. We set the learning\nrate to 5\u0002105and Adam parameters \f1and\f2to0:9and\n0:999, respectively. These hyperparameters are consistent with\ntypical values in the literature. 16-bit ﬂoating point precision\nis used to accelerate ﬁne-tuning and reduce model size on the\nA100s. We record the perplexity of the model on the training\ndata during ﬁne-tuning. This is calculated as the exponentialof the training loss (see Section II-A). Every 1000 optimizer\nsteps, we also test the model using the validation dataset, and\nrecord the perplexity and accuracy at predicting tokens. The\nvalidation dataset is 5% of the full dataset, separate from the\ntraining dataset.\nVI. D OWNSTREAM INFERENCE TASKS AND EVALUATION\nMETRICS\nIn this section, we introduce the benchmarks and metrics\nused to evaluate the performance of the language models.\nA. Code Completion\nA standard benchmark for code generation tasks is the\nHumanEval benchmark [31]. This is comprised of 164 sample\nPython problems, where the input to the model is a natural\nlanguage description of a function and function header. The\nmodel generates code for the function implementation, and is\nscored on functional correctness rather than textual similarity\nor equivalence.\nWe introduce our own adaptation of this benchmark for HPC\nC/C++ programs. Our benchmark consists of 25 custom HPC\ncode generation problems including simple numerics, OpenMP\nparallel code, and MPI routines. Table III lists the tests used\nin our evaluation. Figure 3 shows a sample prompt (top) and\noutput (bottom) for a shared-memory parallel implementation\nofsaxpy . The prompt is provided as input to the model and\nit is expected to generate text functionally equivalent to the\ntext on the bottom.\nTABLE III\nCODE GENERATION TESTS .

This indicates\nthe model’s ability to generate syntactically correct code. For\nthose that compile we compute the pass @kmetric that denotes\nthe probability that at least one of k samples out of Np\ncode samples is correct. We do Nptrials with each prompt\npto generate Npcode samples, compile/run the samples,\nand record the number that are functionally correct ( cp). To\nestimate the probability that at least one of ksamples chosen\nfromNpsamples is correct for a particular prompt, p, we\n(a) Prompt\n1/*\n2multiply scalar float a by vector x and add to y\n3vectors x and y are length N\n4use OpenMP to compute in parallel\n5*/\n6void saxpy(float *x, float *y, float a, int N) {\n(b) Output\n1 #pragma omp parallel for\n2 for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {\n3 y[i] += a *x[i];\n4 }\n5}\nFig. 3. An example prompt asking the model to generate a parallel version of\nsaxpy. The comment and function header make up the prompt. The function\nbody on the bottom shows a potential model output.\ncan use the number of generated samples that are functionally\ncorrect,cp, out of theNptotal samples generated to calculate\npass@kfor a givenkas,\npass@k= 1\u0012Npcp\nk\u0013\n=\u0012Np\nk\u0013\n(1)\nFor each model, we report the average pass@kmetric as the\naverage pass @kover allPprompts as shown below:\naverage pass@k=1\nPPX\ni=1\"\n1Nici\nk\u0001\nNi\nk\u0001#\n(2)\nThis metric provides insight into the probability of a model\ngenerating functionally correct code. In our experiments, we\ncalculate the pass @kscore for several temperatures, namely\n0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, and 0.8, and select the best one. This is\nin line with experiments in related literature [14]. For each\ntemperature and prompt, we generate Np= 100 samples. The\ncode is generated with nucleus sampling using 0:93as the\ncutoff value in the CDF (see Section II).\nTo compile the generated code samples, we use g++ with\nthe “-O2 -std=c++17 -fopenmp ” ﬂags. For tests that\nneed MPI we use the OpenMPI mpicxx compiler. If the build\nis successful, then a corresponding driver binary is called that\nwill call and test the generated function for correctness. These\nare run on a AMD EPYC 7763 CPUs with 64 physical cores\nat 2.45 GHz each. For tests that require OpenMP or MPI we\nonly denote them as correct if they used the corresponding\nparallel framework to compute their result.\nB. Predicting OpenMP Pragmas\nA common HPC coding task is decorating for\nloops with OpenMP pragmas. Every pragma starts with\n#pragma omp parallel for and is followed by a list\nof optional clauses that modify the behavior of the parallel\nfor. We test the model’s ability to write OpenMP pragmas\nfor arbitrary for loops.\nFurther Fine-tuning: We cannot directly use the existing\nmodels to generate pragmas before afor loop, since they areall left-to-right and can only append tokens to sequences. Thus,\nwe need to further ﬁne-tune the models on a smaller dataset\nthat puts the for loop before the pragma. To accomplish this,\nwe ﬁrst create a dataset of every for loop with an OpenMP\npragma from our HPC code dataset. 500 tokens of context\nfrom before the for loop are also included. This results in a\ndataset with 13,900 samples.\nSince our model is left-to-right, we format each sample by\nmoving the pragma to directly after the loop and a unique\nseparating token <begin-omp> . This allows us to use the\nmodel by providing a for loop plus some context and the\nmodel will generate an OpenMP pragma for the for loop.\nEach model is ﬁne-tuned on this smaller dataset for three\nepochs (passes over the entire dataset). To prevent overﬁtting\nwe use a starting learning rate of 3\u0002105. During training\n10% of the dataset is set aside for validation.\nEvaluation Metric: To measure the success of this test, we use\nthe accuracy of generating correct pragmas. This is calculated\nas shown in Equation 3.\naccuracy =# correct pragmas\ntotal pragmas tested(3)\nFor this problem, we deﬁne a correct pragma in two ways:\nsyntactic and functional. To measure syntactic correctness we\ncompare the generated pragma with the actual pragma for\ntextual equivalence. Since it is impossible to automate the\nrunning and evaluation of arbitrary for loops from our dataset\nwe measure functional correctness by comparing the generated\npragmas with the actual ones while ignoring differences that\ndo not contribute to functionality. For instance we ignore\nreordering of variables and clauses where these do not mat-\nter. Additionally, clauses such as schedule are ignored. This\ncorrectness check is done using a custom Python script that\nparses the pragmas and compares them. We record accuracy\nfrom both of these correctness metrics for each model.\nC. Relative Performance Prediction\nIn addition to text generation, we can also use the LLMs\nfor classiﬁcation. Here we use them to predict performance\nslowdowns between two pairs of code.\nFurther Fine-tuning: In order to use the models for relative\nperformance classiﬁcation we need to ﬁrst ﬁne-tune them on\nnew data for this output task. Using the Git commit data from\nSection IV-C we give the model text for a region of code\nbefore and after a Git commit. The codes are concatenated\nwith a unique token separating them, namely <COMMIT> . We\nrepeat a similar process for the code contest dataset, but instead\nseparate pairs by the token <PAIR> . With this data the model\nis ﬁne-tuned to predict whether the second code will be slower\n(positive ) or the same/faster ( negative ).\nFor each dataset we ﬁne-tune the model on 90% of the\ndata with the other 10% set aside for evaluation. The model\ntakes the concatenated sequences of the two versions of\nthe code implementation and is ﬁne-tuned for the binary\nclassiﬁcation problem of predicting relative performance. The\ntraining objective is classiﬁcation accuracy, which we also use\nto measure success for this task.\nEvaluation Metric: To evaluate the performance on this\ntask we measure the model’s classiﬁcation accuracy. This is\ncalculated as shown in Equation 4.\naccuracy =# correct performance predictions\ntotal performance predictions(4)\nFor this metric higher is better and a classiﬁcation accuracy\nof 100% signiﬁes a perfect score.\nVII. R ESULTS\nWe now present the ﬁne-tuning and evaluation results using\nthe downstream tasks discussed in Section VI.\nA. Fine-tuning on HPC Source Code Data\nWe ﬁrst show the results of ﬁne-tuning the three models\nselected in Table II. Table IV shows the validation perplexity\nat the end of ﬁne-tuning. Here perplexity is calculated as the\nexponential of the loss as described in Section II. Each model\nconverges to a low perplexity score over the separate testing\nset (between 2 and 4). GPT-Neo and PolyCoder achieve com-\nparable perplexity scores (within 0.01) while GPT2 achieves a\nhigher perplexity. All three have different pre-training datasets\nand the former two are of a larger size than GPT2 (see\nTable II). From this we can conclude that for this problem\nthe pre-training dataset had less of an impact on validation\nperplexity than the model size. The lower perplexity of the\nlarger models means that they model the language better.\nTABLE IV\nFINAL VALIDATION PERPLEXITIES FOR EACH MODEL AFTER FINE -TUNING\nON THE HPC SOURCE CODE DATASET .\nModel GPT-2 GPT-Neo PolyCoder\nFinal Validation Perplexity 4.47 2.23 2.24\nFor the rest of the results presented in this section we\nwill use PolyCoder+HPC, GPT-Neo+HPC, and GPT2+HPC to\nrefer to the respective models ﬁne-tuned on the HPC dataset.\nAfter ﬁne-tuning each of the models and evaluating them\non the downstream tasks we noticed that the perplexity would\nkeep improving with more ﬁne-tuning, but the downstream\nevaluation performance would start to decrease. This is likely\nbecause LLMs are subject to catastrophic forgetting during\nﬁne-tuning. Catastrophic forgetting is the phenomenon where\npreviously learned information is lost or forgotten as the model\ncontinues training and updating its weights. It is typically\nprevented by minimizing the amount of ﬁne-tuning and using\na sufﬁciently low learning rate.\nTo explore this phenomenon we ran the code generation\ntasks every 1000 samples during ﬁne-tuning of the PolyCoder\nmodel. Figure 4 presents the results from our evaluation tests\nduring ﬁne-tuning on the PolyCoder model. After seeing about\n45,000 samples during ﬁne-tuning the model starts to decrease\nin evaluation performance. This is in contrast to the perplexitywhich keeps improving past 45,000 samples. Based on this\nresult we stop ﬁne-tuning at 45,000 samples and use these\nweights for the rest of the evaluations. Additionally, due to the\ncomputation time needed to run this test we use the 45,000\nsamples stopping point for ﬁne-tuning all the models.\nFig. 4. Downstream evaluation performance across training iterations for\nPolyCoder+HPC. The model starts to perform worse around 45,000 samples\neven though the perplexity keeps improving.\nB. Code Completion\nHaving ﬁne-tuned the three models, we now start using them\nfor the different downstream tasks described in Section VI.\nThe ﬁrst downstream task is code generation, described in\nSection VI-A. Figure 5 shows the average pass@k rates for\nthe code generation tests. The average pass@k values are\ncomputed according to Equation 2. We use PolyCoder as a\nbaseline for comparison since it is a state-of-the-art LLM for\ncode generation. PolyCoder+HPC scores the best for average\npass@1, pass@10, and pass@100. For each value of kthe\nmodels score in the order of PolyCoder+HPC, PolyCoder,\nGPT-Neo+HPC, and GPT2+HPC. PolyCoder+HPC gains the\nslight edge over the original PolyCoder by successfully gen-\nerating code for the HPC-speciﬁc tasks (see Figure 6).\nFig. 5. Comparison of models on code generation. The clusters represent the\naverage pass@k scores for k= 1;10and100. Higher percentage is better.\n\nIn Figure 5 we see that GPT2+HPC scores signiﬁcantly\nlower than the other models. This is likely due to the smaller\nmodel size and the fact that there is no source code in its pre-\ntraining dataset. In this instance ﬁne-tuning is not enough to\nenable GPT-2 to generate correct C++ HPC code.\nAltogether, the scores are indicative that PolyCoder+HPC\nand GPT-Neo+HPC has learned how to generate valid C++\ncode. For instance, if the best model, PolyCoder+HPC, is\npermitted to generate 100 samples, then 71% of them are\ncorrect on average across all the tests. Similarly for 1 sample\ngenerated this is 25%. These numbers roughly align with\nresults from [14] on the HumanEval Python tests. However, the\nresults are not directly comparable since they are a different\nset of tests in a different programming language.\nTo demonstrate the generative capabilities of the specialized\nmodels we reduce the code generation tasks to those that\nare speciﬁc to HPC. This includes code that uses OpenMP\nand/or MPI parallelism. Figure 6 shows the performance when\nrestricted to these tests. We see that PolyCoder is unable to\ngenerate OpenMP and MPI code as it scores signiﬁcantly\nlower than the rest. GPT2+HPC still performs fairly low,\nhowever, its score has actually improved slightly over Figure 5.\nThis is due to the fact that it has only seen HPC-speciﬁc code\nduring training and that is what is being tested here.\nFig. 6. Comparison of models on code generation for HPC-speciﬁc functions.\nThe clusters represent the average pass@k scores for k= 1; 10and 100.\nHigher percentage is better.\nAnother point of interest besides functional correctness\nis syntactic correctness. This can be measured by the total\nnumber of generated samples that compile successfully. This\nis how often the model generates valid code, whether it is func-\ntionally correct or not. This data is presented in Figure 7. Poly-\nCoder and PolyCoder+HPC both perform the best compared\nto the other models with 84% and 86% of samples compiling\ncorrectly, respectively. GPT-Neo+HPC performs slightly worse\nat 74% and GPT2-HPC has only 30% of samples compile. The\nworse performance of the latter two can likely be attribute to\ntheir pre-training datasets having less code. We also observe\nthat for all models there is a visual correlation between build\nand correctness rates, which is expected as a model needs to\ncompile in order to be functionally correct.\nFig. 7. Comparison of the models’ build rate. Both PolyCoder and Poly-\nCoder+HPC have the best percentage of total samples that successfully\ncompile. Higher percentage is better.\nThe code in Figure 8 shows example output from PolyCoder\nand PolyCoder+HPC on generating OpenMP code to compute\na sum in parallel. We see that PolyCoder is able to produce\ncorrect sequential code, however, it fails to add any OpenMP\npragmas. The PolyCoder+HPC model is able to correctly tag\nthe for loop with an OpenMP pragma.\n(a) Prompt\n1/*\n2Compute the sum of the array X and return the sum.\n3X has N elements.\n4Use OpenMP to compute the sum in parallel.\n5*/\n6float sum(float *X, int N) {\n(b) PolyCoder output\n1 float sum = 0.0f;\n2 for (int i = 0; i < N; i++)\n3 sum += X[i];\n4 return sum;\n5}\n(c) PolyCoder+HPC output\n1 float sum = 0.0f;\n2 #pragma omp parallel for reduction(+:sum)\n3 for (int i = 0; i < N; i++)\n4 sum += X[i];\n5 return sum;\n6}\nFig. 8. Example OpenMP output from (b) PolyCoder and (c) Poly-\nCoder+HPC. The comment and function description (top) make up the prompt\nthat is given to the model, while the bottom two blocks are the generated\ntext. We see that PolyCoder is unable to generate OpenMP pragmas for the\nreduction in this example.\nA similar example with distributed memory is shown in\nFigure 9. The PolyCoder+HPC is able to generate correct MPI\ncode to compute an average in parallel across ranks. PolyCoder\noften generated long and incorrect code that demonstrated little\nunderstanding of how to write MPI routines. The example\npresented is indicative of the rest of the MPI samples generated\n\nby PolyCoder. Notably, some instances did contain MPI calls,\nso PolyCoder must have some MPI code in its pre-training\ndataset. However, it lacked the ability to properly use MPI.\n(a) Prompt\n1/*\n2 Use MPI to compute the average of X across ranks\n3 and return the result on all ranks.\n4 Use the default communicator.\n5*/\n6double mpiAverage(double X) {\n(b) PolyCoder output\n1 int rank;\n2 int nprocs;\n3 double average;\n4 MPI_Status status;\n5 MPI_Request request;\n6\n7 MPI_Init(&argc, &argv);\n8 MPI_Comm_rank(MPI_COMM_WORLD, &rank);\n9 MPI_Comm_size(MPI_COMM_WORLD, &nprocs);\n10\n11 if (rank == 0) {\n12 MPI_Recv(&status, 1, MPI_INT, 0, 0,\nMPI_COMM_WORLD,\n13 &request);\n14 MPI_Send(&X, 1, MPI_INT, 0, 0,\nMPI_COMM_WORLD);\n15 MPI_Send(&average, 1, MPI_DOUBLE, 0, 0,\n16 MPI_COMM_WORLD);\n17 }\n18 return average;\n19}\n(c) PolyCoder+HPC output\n1 int size;\n2 double sum;\n3\n4 MPI_Comm_size(MPI_COMM_WORLD, &size);\n5 MPI_Allreduce(&X, &sum, 1, MPI_DOUBLE, MPI_SUM,\n6 MPI_COMM_WORLD);\n7\n8 return sum / size;\n9}\nFig. 9. Example MPI output from (b) PolyCoder and (c) PolyCoder+HPC.\nThe highlighted region is code generated by the model (reformatted to ﬁt the\ncolumn). PolyCoder results varied signiﬁcantly, however, the above example\ndemonstrates the general lack of understanding it had for MPI.\nFigure 10 shows the speedups for the code generated by\nPolyCoder+HPC over sequential baselines. These are hand-\nwritten efﬁcient, sequential implementations for each test. We\nsee that PolyCoder+HPC is able to generate code that is faster\nthan the sequential baseline. This demonstrates that it is not\ngenerating very poor performing parallel code and is likely\nusing the parallelism correctly.\nSince PolyCoder+HPC scores the highest in training and\nthese code generation tests we select it for further compar-\nisons in the rest of the paper. PolyCoder+HPC is the ﬁne-\ntuned model we present as HPC-Coder. We continue to use\nPolyCoder as a baseline.\nFig. 10. Comparison of the speedups for the code generation tests over\nsequential baselines. They are all above 1 demonstrating that the model is\nnot generating very poor performing parallel code.\nC. Predicting OpenMP Pragmas\nNext, we examine the result from the OpenMP prediction\ntests described in Section VI-B. Figure 11 shows the results\nfrom the OpenMP experiments detailed in Section VI-B.\nWe see that both models are able to generate functionally\ncorrect OpenMP pragmas with high accuracy (right plot).\nPolyCoder+HPC is able to do this with 97% accuracy and\nPolyCoder 94%. The LLMs are exemplary at understanding\nthe dependencies of the for loop and what clauses are\nrequired to correctly parallelize them. We see that the model\nthat has seen large amounts of OpenMP code performs better.\nWe can also look at how well the models reproduce the\npragmas exactly. This means all the clauses and variables\nwithin those clauses are in the same order in the dataset and\nin the output from the model. These results are shown in the\nleft plot in Figure 11. While less meaningful than functional\ncorrectness, it is interesting that the model is able to exactly\nreproduce pragmas it has not seen before with relatively high\naccuracy (67% and 61%). This is likely due to certain trends\nin the construction and ordering of OpenMP clauses that the\nLLMs are learning as they train.\nFig. 11. Comparison of models on predicting OpenMP pragmas. The left\nplot presents accuracy in predicting OpenMP pragmas exactly as they appear\nin the dataset. The right plot shows the accuracy in predicting functionally\ncorrect OpenMP pragmas. Higher accuracy is better.\n\nD. Relative Performance Prediction\nFinally, we look at the results from the relative performance\nprediction tests described in Section VI-C. Figure 12 shows the\nresults from the relative performance prediction tests (see Sec-\ntion VI-C). Both models achieve high classiﬁcation accuracy\nwith PolyCoder+HPC being slightly better for the two proxy\napplications at 88% and PolyCoder at 86%. This means that\nfor 88% of the code changes in the two repositories version\ncontrol history PolyCoder+HPC is able to correctly identify\nif there will be a performance slowdown. Likewise for the\nprogramming competition dataset we see that PolyCoder+HPC\noutperforms the PolyCoder baseline with an accuracy of 92%\nvs 86%. This is a higher accuracy improvement than the proxy\napplications by 4 percentage points. This is likely due to the\nfact that the programming competition dataset is larger and\nPolyCoder+HPC has been trained on more C/C++ code.\nFig. 12. Comparison of models on predicting relative performance of code\nchanges. Both models achieve similarly high accuracy. The PolyCoder+HPC\nmodel performs slightly better on both datasets. Higher accuracy is better.\nThe success of this test demonstrates that the models are\nable to correlate their prior language understanding with\nperformance related properties of code. This means we can\nleverage LLMs and ﬁne-tuning to model code performance\nwithout the need to collect large amounts data.\nVIII. R ELATED WORK\nIn this section we detail related work that uses LLMs to\nstudy source code and work that uses machine learning to\nmodel the performance of source code.\nA. LLMs for Code Generation\nWith the explosion in research in transformer models and\nLLMs there have been a large number of papers applying\nthese techniques to source code. Most of these methods have\nextended GPT-2 [16], GPT-3 [23], or BERT [32], [33] models\nand trained them on code. A notable instance is Codex [2],\nwhich is a modiﬁcation of GPT-3 that is targeted for source\ncode generation. Following Codex’s introduction there have\nbeen several other works that have introduced state-of-the-art\nlarge language models [3], [4], [34]. While some of these\nare open source, the best, such as GPT-4 [24], keep theirarchitecture, weights, and training data closed source and only\ninference is available via a paid API.\nA large amount of this recent research has focused on code\ngeneration. These usually take a mix of code and natural\nlanguage and learn how to meaningfully ﬁnish the code. While\nseminal works have continued to improve code generation\nwith better and bigger models [2], [23], [33], other works\nhave explored how to better utilize these tools in software\nengineering workﬂows [35]–[37]. Some ﬂip code generation\naround and learn to generate natural language code summaries\nfrom code snippets [7]–[10].\nThese models can even be trained for tasks such bug and\nmalware detection [11], [12]. LLMs can also be used to\nsuggest ﬁxes in these cases rather than just identify prob-\nlematic code. Many other previously difﬁcult to automate\nsoftware development tasks have since been tackled by ap-\nplying LLMs [6]. More recently some of these tasks have\nincluded HPC development tasks such as race detection [38]\nand OpenACC compiler validation [39].\nB. Machine Learning Applied to Source Code Performance\nHowever, one important problem in software development\nthat has not received much research with LLMs is that of\nperformance. Many of the reasons listed in Section I have\nprevented meaningful studies from being accomplished. Pre-\nviously approaches used code2vec [40], ir2vec [41], or a\nsimilar method to ﬁrst map source code to an embedded space\nthat could then be learned on. These were successfully used\nfor some performance related analytical modeling such as\nOpenCL kernel device placement [41], but never leveraged\nLLMs for a full performance study.\nGarg et al. [42] recently introduced DeepDevPERF, which\nis a BART-based [43] LLM designed to suggest performance\nimprovements to arbitrary C# code. They overcome the issue\nof data collection by using code changes from Git commits that\nhave performance related keywords in their commit message,\nalbeit, this dataset is still noisy. This work is different than\nthat presented in this paper as it suggests code transformations\nrather than learn relative performance. The latter being useful\nin cases where two versions of a code already exist, such as\nwith Git commits. Additionally, our model is trained on real\nperformance data and can be used for HPC and parallel code\ngeneration tasks.\nIX. C ONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK\nIn this paper, we have demonstrated the ﬁne-tuning of an\nLLM using HPC code, and its ability to outperform other\nLLMs in HPC related tasks such as HPC code generation and\nperformance modeling. We have accomplished this by ﬁne-\ntuning a model, and showing that it can generate functionally\ncorrect HPC code at up to a 53% higher pass@k rate and\ncan accurately label for loops with OpenMP pragmas with\n97% success. We have further demonstrated how this ﬁne-\ntuned model can be utilized to study performance properties\nof source code with little data. These results demonstrate the\nneed for and usefulness of HPC-speciﬁc language models. The\n\nbest model in our experiments, PolyCoder+HPC, we present\nasHPC-Coder .\nIn the future, we plan to explore further analyses that can\nbe accomplished using our language model. We also plan on\nexploring how to tune the model to generate not just correct\nbut performant code. Additionally, we plan to investigate how\nto engineer these innovations into practical tools that can be\neasily used by computational scientists and HPC developers\nto enable them to produce better code more efﬁciently.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThis material is based upon work supported in part by\nthe National Science Foundation under Grant No. 2047120.\nThis work was performed in part under the auspices of the\nU.S. Department of Energy by Lawrence Livermore National\nLaboratory under Contract DE-AC52-07NA27344 (LLNL-\nCONF-844549).\nREFERENCES\n[1] W.
