It appears that the knowledge base does not have indexed content directly addressing "evolutionary model merging" or key variants such as "ensemble model merging using evolutionary algorithms," "federated learning model merging with evolutionary strategies," or specific reviews and surveys in this space. This is likely due either to the recent emergence of this topic as a distinct subfield, sparse or siloed literature, or terminology variance in how the problem is described.

**Before proceeding to speculative synthesis or broader analogies, I must clarify:**
- There are scant or no consolidated reviews/articles specifically tagged as "evolutionary model merging" in the available knowledge base. 
- This does *not* mean research on related ideas (e.g., merging neural networks, evolutionary ensemble methods, or federated learning model fusion) does not exist, but the database does not have responses mapping those precise queries.

**Proposed Next Steps:**
1. **Widen the search language** to include:
   - “evolutionary neural architecture search,”
   - “model combination with genetic algorithms,”
   - “evolutionary ensemble learning,”
   - “federated averaging with evolutionary methods,”
   - “knowledge distillation using evolutionary algorithms.”

2. **Explore adjacent, established topics** like:
   - Ensemble learning (particularly evolutionary ensemble design),
   - Neural architecture search (NAS) using evolutionary strategies,
   - Model fusion or composition in meta-learning,
   - Genetic programming for model evolution.

3. **If there is still no direct corpus,** I will need to (a) synthesize what foundational research would look like based on established sub-fields, and (b) perform the survey as a critical and thematic integration across these spaces.

Would you like me to proceed by expanding the search to related and adjacent fields as described above, and build a comprehensive literature survey based on those findings and best practices of how evolutionary principles have influenced model merging and fusion? This approach would ensure a meaningful, critically analytical survey, even if the field as a discrete topic is nascent or underindexed.
